 Joe Rogan, what are you doing?
 You running for president?
 Yes.
 What made you decide to do that?
 Aren't you busy enough?
 Clothing company?
 Successful rapper?
 Family man?
 It was something that God put on my heart back in 2015.
 A few days before the MTV Awards, it hit me in the shower.
 And when I first thought of it, I just started laughing to myself.
 All this joy came over my body, just through my soul.
 I just felt that energy, I felt that spirit.
 So then two days later, I accepted the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Awards at the MTV Awards.
 Instead of performing, my Aurea hit songs, I gave just my perspective on award shows.
 But I knew at the end that I was going to tell people I'm running for president in 2020.
 And it even took heart to say it in that context.
 And people were just like, oh, their minds were blown.
 And then I was hanging out with different friends that were some people in the music industry,
 some people tech elites, different things like that.
 And they would really, they just really took it as a joke.
 And they're telling me all these millions of reasons why I couldn't run for president.
 I remember running into Oprah two days or one day after that.
 She's like, you don't want to be president.
 And people just thought projecting, putting this on you.
 And I remember saying one of my responses to one of the people that one of the naysayers was,
 well, definitely be a billionaire by that time.
 And that's a reason why someone should become president.
 But as a say, you know, at that time I was 50, around $50 million in debt.
 And I knew I had the confidence that I would be able to turn that around.
 And now, you know, just going into, I want to just give you a, that's a clear answer.
 Right. I know what you're saying.
 I don't want to go off on two of them.
 No, it's okay.
 What you're basically saying is you know how to set goals, you know how to achieve them.
 But what was Oprah's rationale when she said, you don't want to be the president.
 Like, what was she saying?
 Remember when people were saying that that's our next president?
 Remember when Trump got elected, you know, they showed Oprah and they were saying like,
 I believe it was like NBC tweeted it.
 This is our next president.
 Like, they were a lot of people wanted Oprah to want to run.
 And they felt like if Trump could win, Oprah could win.
 When I saw Trump win, I was like, see, you can win.
 You know, I was, you can win if you're coming from outside of politics.
 I was young when Ronald Reagan was in, was president.
 But Ronald Reagan was the governor of California before he was the president.
 He had actually proven himself as a politician, at least somewhat.
 Which is an idea that people have thrown out at me to...
 To be governor of California?
 To be governor of California.
 So anyone's better than this guy.
 Just do it. Just go ahead, start there.
 Yeah.
 In a shot.
 Open things up again, man.
 But I think, I think my calling is to be...
 I believe that my calling is to be the leader of the free world.
 Not, not, I mean, if it's in God's plan that part of my path is to be the governor, then that's fine.
 But my calling is to be the leader of the free world.
 So when you say this, like when you say your calling is to be the leader of the free world,
 what does that mean to you?
 Does it mean do you have a plan that's different than the plans that have been implemented before?
 Does it mean that you have ideas?
 What kind of plan?
 Like the plan to be the leader.
 Like what would you do if you were the leader of the free world?
 Like what would be different about the way you would handle things?
 Like if that's your plan, like what is it about that that is your calling?
 Like why would you want to do that?
 Like what do you want to do differently if you were the leader of the free world?
 Well, there was a couple of questions in there.
 You said why is that your calling?
 There's people who say to me, you know, they'll say, well music is bigger than politics or more influential than politics or celebrities or more influential.
 And I thought of it like if I was a pastor of a hundred thousand person church, but then I was also a captain, a sailor.
 And then we went to war and I said, I'm going to man this ship that has a thousand people, a thousand soldiers on it because God is calling me to take this position.
 Even though I'm the pastor for, you know, however big my audience is in hip hop, in music or as an influencer or celebrity or just as a dad and a husband in my house,
 the world is like, there couldn't be a better time to put a visionary in the captain's chair.
 And that's not to say we haven't had visionaries before.
 I'm not coming here to down any of the other, I'm not here to down, Trump down, Biden, I'm just here to express why.
 Why God has called me to take this position.
 So when you say a visionary, you think of yourself in terms of like as an artist, as a creator, someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in terms of music and art and creation design, the things that you do.
 That's why you think you're different as a visionary.
 Yeah, I think that I think I'm different from, I mean, we're all different.
 So I'm definitely different from everybody, but we're all different from each other.
 I mean, I do bump into people that seem to be like the same character inside of it.
 It's like, I've seen more people before.
 Yeah, people play the same roles. Like, well, I just met you before.
 You're just like the head of this company over here, the same kind of person.
 Yeah, you know, I mean, I manifest, I see things, I'm a great leader because I listen and I'm empathetic and I feel the entire earth and I feel us as a species, as the human race.
 Sometimes people think utopia is almost like a negative word.
 That's like, we couldn't have that, but I do believe in world peace.
 Like the people hit me with the, one of the things Oprah said is she said, you got to bone up on your foreign affairs.
 I remember this, like, because it's Oprah talking.
 I'm going to remember a lot of what the conversation was, but that's the first thing she said was, you know, foreign affairs and foreign policies.
 Like, just, I think the reason why I say leader in that politician and not even specifically president is this is the time, you know, when the Constitution was written, that was an innovation.
 Now, the world is innovative all around our political system, but we have been innovative and simplified our political system.
 So I met with this gentleman, Sam, one of the founders of Y Combinator.
 So Y Combinator is a contract that my friend, the head of Dropbox, used, and that a lot of tech guys used, and it's a standardized deal.
 So one of the ideas I had when I was, as I'm in this process of innovate, I'm not in war with the music industry.
 It's just, it's time for us to innovate. And we need to have contracts that make sense with exactly how we sell music.
 So, you know, people, every vicinity, and that's like every 20 years, that's like the like decade is 10 of a city is 20.
 And as you see now, it's like the world has just stopped for a second.
 And there's an opportunity to look and say, what are the things we need? What are the things we don't need?
 So I don't know if you saw when I posted my contract. I had 10 contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth.
 And there's things that we don't need. Now, I believe that the distribution partner that the label is, like Prince would go and say, we don't need the distribution partner.
 So, I think that's the first thing that Prince was really alive and thriving in this internet era.
 I'm the kind of person where I'm not trying to go and eliminate anyone's job.
 So record labels are afraid of saying, okay, we're going to hand over the distribution completely to you guys.
 Which is, you know, that's a possibility.
 There's a way where both parties can be happy and that these infrastructural partners can be of service to the influencer to the artist.
 Like these deals can be flipped in a way that they're just more fair.
 So, you know, record, let me just go into this specific place with the record labels for a second.
 Yeah, I'm talking about that for a while.
 Because it's a confusing thing for people on the outside.
 Yeah. So, before, when I told my father I wanted to rap, he was very like leery of that idea.
 He said, I heard this business is terrible.
 And, you know, he's right.
 Like people are all seeing things that are wrong inside of contracts, turning blind eyes to it, and everyone's responsible.
 Everyone's a part of it.
 You know, it's like when the Me Too movement happened, you know, it wasn't just the guys that were getting tagged.
 And, you know, some of the guys should have got to hit with it.
 Some guys shouldn't, you know, that's not what I'm here to talk about.
 And, you know, I'm saying that in a way, everyone's responsible.
 Everyone's a part of the problem.
 That's why I really love that Black Mirror episode when, you know, everyone was making comments.
 And, anyone that even made a comment, the bees, it was about these, you know, mechanical bees.
 Anyone, and this is a spoiler alert, if you haven't seen this episode.
 But, anyone who made a comment, the bees came to go get them.
 And, that's the thing about what you put in the universe, even a thought.
 You know, you put that thought into the, it's another thing to say something negative, and put that into the universe.
 It's another thing to see someone being raped.
 You know, that's the reason why I compare what's happening to, in the music industry, to Me Too, because artists are raped.
 You've heard that term before.
 This is not like, I'm, this is not like a new thing that I'm making up.
 The tracks are made to rape the artist.
 And, you know, I put my, like I think about, you know, this is like a thought right now.
 It's like, is this a negative thought that I'm putting into the universe?
 But I have to say, like, when I was going on Twitter, I was thinking about Bruce and Brandon Lee.
 That crossed my mind to say, this is Sony.
 This is Universal.
 And I'm willing to put the blue, paint on my face, and go out, and do this, because it's the right thing to do.
 Like, music, like at this point, it loses me money.
 It doesn't make, it doesn't make me money.
 It is my $5 billion net worth, and $300 million of cash that I see a year, music is like negative 4 million for me.
 So, these contracts for me were kind of like, Wangro and Heat, where this guy had everything, but he still said,
 Wangro messed up this, this, this, this, this high step we're going to do.
 Like, I look at the music industry, not music, and the love of music itself, but the music industry, I look at it like Wangro, like,
 I blame, you know, the loss of my mother, partially on the entertainment industry.
 The always fighting to, you know, represent, you know, who you are against media, entertainment industry that's trying to tear down anybody that's not going with the flow.
 I see, you know, I've got those kind of reasons personally, but Vengeance's mindset, the Lord.
 So, it's not a matter of going there and for revenge.
 That's just me as a human being where I fall short. Like, I'm not a monk.
 Can you explain what you're talking about with Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee?
 Like, what, I lost you there.
 Okay, so Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee were both murdered.
 Well, Brandon Lee died in an accident on a movie set.
 Yeah.
 Do you think it was a murder?
 I felt it's that's a conspiracy, right?
 The conspiracy was that the Chinese triad killed him the same way they killed Bruce, but the corners report was that Bruce died from a reaction to a medication, right?
 Yeah, I mean, but I think about that anytime I go to the, go to the hospital.
 I'm very, you know, I'm mindful of that stuff.
 You think about like Bob Marley, they didn't just JFK or MLK him.
 There's like reports that it was something in his toe or the other cancer, right?
 I believe he had a skin cancer.
 Yeah, like I went to go, I got a shot in my, in my hand, because just from texting and stuff, my thumb was like hurt.
 And then I post so much you hurt your thumb?
 Absolutely. Just texting way too much.
 So I post a picture of the screen at the hospital and then I was asked to take it down by, by who?
 People just call me.
 I've forgotten exactly who asked me, but it was like they got to my management.
 They got to this and they said, take that picture down.
 Like the hospital.
 It was in the weirdest place.
 You know, so what, what do they not like about the picture?
 I think it had like, it might have had some information on it that they didn't want to go out like a address or something like that.
 It's just like, but I don't want to go down, go down these rabbit holes.
 I'm just saying like Michael Jackson, not waking up one day, Prince not waking up one day, Bruce and Brandon Lee, Bob Marley.
 All of these things are have crossed my mind.
 You know, as I'm going and saying, I need to innovate with these contracts are not just for me, but for all artists.
 It's not about me getting my master's back.
 It's about freedom.
 And I say on a new song, I say, if I would put myself in harm's way to get my masters, they would put theirself in harm's way to stay the master.
 And that's, there's a complete parallel to the way the music industry works and the way the world currently works.
 And the influence that America has on other countries and the way governments work.
 The influence and the way government and the way people in power and control deal with, you know, disaster relief deal with Haiti deal with the Bahamas.
 Like where is the money going? Why aren't things being built? And this concept of money, right?
 I asked someone a week ago, like, how much is America and debt? And they were like, this many trillion.
 And then I asked my, a rhetorical question, but the dumbest question I've ever asked myself, I said, well, you know, how much does the earth cost?
 Think about a bad question.
 All the things on earth.
 And it's saying we can't buy it. We couldn't make enough money to buy the earth, right?
 So that means we made money. So if money is the key to all people's happiness and we'll solve everything and everyone's doing things for money, let's just make more money.
 But it's not about making more money. It's about keeping poor people poor and rich people rich and keeping people in their place.
 And right now, we're experiencing the fall or roam or the Titanic has now hit a glacier.
 And there's people who would prefer to go down with the Titanic than to get on a lifeboat because they don't want to get seawater on their dress or on a nice outfit.
 The people are so programmed and brainwashed into a classism and protectionism that it's difficult for people to embrace innovation.
 Unless it has a tag on it that's got a name, brand connected to it that says, with this innovation, you will be better than the person.
 You'll be better than your next door neighbor.
 You know, when I made Sunday service, I completely stopped rapping because I didn't know how to rap for God.
 You know, all my raps always had like nasty jokes on it.
 And then, you know, I made...
 When I went to the hospital, I know you want to get into this. When I went to the hospital in 2016, I wrote, uh, Start a Church in Calabasas.
 And as you left from 2018, going into 2019, I said, I'm not going to let one Sunday go by without starting this church.
 And there's people who said it wasn't a church and different things. But to start a ministry, I'm like the little drummer boy, when I'm saying, you know, this all I got to bring, my drum.
 I might not be well versed in the word. But I know how to make music. I know how to put this choir together.
 And all things can be made good for God. So it like quickly became the best choir of all time because all the best singers moved to California.
 And now, but a lot of them grew up in the church. So it's like the opportunity for them to actually get paid singing for God because I would be funding it.
 And that for me was like a tie for me to fund Sunday service. And I was four months in before I gave my life to God.
 Like I wasn't saved. It's just I had a calling saying, just go make this church.
 The whole thing that the comparison to this church to me going and saying, okay, why am I running for president is to be in service.
 And that service to my own ego.
 You know, I feel like God says to me like, haven't I given you enough.
 Like I gave you an ego that helped you overcome all these, you know, roadblocks and smoke screens and people telling you what you can't do.
 Now you need to realize when you're doing things for your ego and when you're doing things for me, this is like God.
 What I feel God is saying to me.
 Because it really irritates me when people say God told me to tell you.
 So I'm very like mindful with this kind of word and this I'm saying I have a feeling that that's what God is saying for me to be in service.
 So the ultimate service position is leader of the free world to be the president of the United States.
 Sometimes you see me on Twitter, I say I want all the smoke. I want all the problems because the problems are the opportunities.
 There's an opportunity to solve things and Kurzweil, he created the keyboard Kurzweil.
 He has this video that Mark Romantic, this director that shot 99 problems for Jay-Z, which is like my favorite, maybe like top five or top two favorite videos of all time.
 He also did a closer for Trent Resner and I like, I just grew up on MTV in the 90s and I love Mark Romantic videos.
 But he would share little bits and pieces.
 I remember Ray Kurzweil talking about the ability for us to have a utopia but us being led by the least noble and the most greedy.
 But if someone or when someone gets in a position of leadership that is in service to God and in service to people, period, but immediately the American people.
 I had this joke I was saying like, man, no one outside of our country should be able to see these debates. This is family business right here. This is only for America to see.
 We can't let anyone outside the country see. But to be in service. So I stepped away already from my rap career for a year and served God every week, sometimes twice a week, three times a week.
 Never miss a Sunday until COVID. And this is thing. There are people inside of the church stealing, doing different things, trying to just take them and God still provided a way for us to keep that boat of float.
 We never missed a service. And then one of my pastors, pastor Adam, who is the way he preaches is called expository.
 It's like one to one by the word. I like all different kind of preachers, but there's some type of preachers. They get up, they have the Bible in their hand and they close the Bible and then they just talk for a two hours.
 And it's and and some do have anointing, but the expository preachers go line for line. And for me, it's like I come from entertainment. I got so much sauce. I don't need no sauce on the word.
 I need the word to be solid food that I can understand exactly what God was saying to me through the King James version. Do this, you know, through this translation or the English and it version.
 So pastor Adams was coming by my spot. I got this 300 acres spot in Calabasas that we had a little house in that I was recording.
 And I would play this music, these chords that I love, they're almost like monk like.
 And that's going to go into someone talk about later because I'm building a monstery. I'm building them a monastery that will then be the future of a monastery is this like full sustainable energy.
 Now he says to me pastor Adams says to me when I was thinking about should I wrap her night he said my son just said, you know, I wish I want to hear you rap do album about Jesus, a rap album about Jesus.
 And it was through the mouth of babes like this person, I'm going to listen to the kids, bro. You know, I'm going to listen to my daughter. I'm going to listen to kids before I listen to, you know, super programmed out adults.
 And especially if that adult hasn't done something that I am looking to do.
 So it's so funny how people are so like free and almost arrogant with their advice. And I'm just like, why would I listen to you? You don't even ask me for any advice. I'm the most successful person I know.
 And also the so you said my son wants to hear a rap album from you. And that just that was that was the paradigm shift for me. I used that word a lot. I like that. I like paradigm shift is one of the favorite.
 And I made this rap album. And you know, for a lot of people it was the first album that they could play with a certain production level in the house with their with their family.
 Now, you know, you could argue if the watch the throne production was stronger or better than Jesus is King production.
 But when I go and I like I've been working with Dr. Dre and some of the beats just be like, you know, the hardest beats possible. And it's something that was very spiritual and meditative about the mix on Jesus is King that it wasn't hitting his heart as Jesus or hitting his heart as a watch the throne. It was like, this is how God wanted me to make this make this sonic painting.
 And the way he wanted me to communicate then so we did that album. And then we did the Jesus is born album, which also I got that idea from pastor Adams.
 And I mean, there's people who that's the only album they play. And it's just bringing these gospel. And I tell you like my formula for these hymns I'm writing because I'm writing the songs that we're doing at Sunday service is basically my
 book of hymns for the future gospel university that I'm creating where I've envisioned and will manifest a 200,000 seat stadium circular with a hundred thousand gospel singers. And people will go to this university. And they will train the way, you know, a Russian Olympic swimmer, you know, a picture like they would be in the pool six days a week at least.
 If not seven days, but for people who sing for the church or, you know, you know, because it's it's a tide is pro bonus all this like people don't practice that as much as we practice going to studio to rap or practice playing basketball for in the NBA.
 And I'm making the NBA so to say the Coliseum for God and what that if you have you heard like soccer chance and I just like 60,000. So I envision that for God a hundred thousand people sometimes singing and harmony sometimes in unison.
 Glory, glory, oh God, all mine we lift our hands and give praise. Glory, glory, oh God, all my we lift our hands and give you praise.
 Glory, but picture a hundred thousand people in unison and that feeling what that would do for our spirits, our souls, it's healing. There's natural forms of healing about our environment.
 The friends that we're around what we're wearing what we're eating our diet so Donda is a design company that that I formed around 10 years ago and some of the people that worked at Donda are now have went on to become heads of fashion houses like a Virgil's the head of Louis Vuitton and he was the head of Donda at a certain point.
 Another guy that worked at Donda is now the head of Givenchy so this is like the talent pool and this Donda is basically my version of like a cyber extension of my brain like there's something that I'm thinking of that you can't touch but we need to we need to bring it into fruition.
 We need to manifest it and we have to see how to use things of our past and things of our now to create our future so it's a organization created to guarantee the future of the human race really I thought about even calling it Edna because I see us all the superheroes and Edna was the designer in the Incredibles.
 We're just kind of almost really similar to Donda I'm just seeing these lineups and stuff so so now our focus is food clothing shelter communication education and transportation so at the school that I just created easy Christian Academy you know we call NASA we call different places about this hydroponic vertical growing garden and I remember sitting you know the idea of the garden is the best way to do it.
 You know from A to Z you have to be able to make your food right there fully sustainable right there on your land and you know as a bunch of people like all made this salad right here it's like I'm at that good enough you still got to go to the grocery store for 80% 60% of your stuff I remember this one you know this one farmer we had you know he wanted to build this class for the kids and all this and we're going to show the kids this like people always make the kids version I don't like this the kids version thing like
 kids need to understand how what of the pandemic was you know they lost all their parents and it was also kids need to understand early how real life works so physics is one of the anchors of the school that I'm creating I remember you know I'm the city is all self-sustaining so it works off of our four main resources earth when water and fire and 90% of it is running off of water.
 With like aqueducts like the city of Masada and I was talking to this engineer and saying I need the whole thing to run off of water and he said we're going to have to use solar power and I said I don't and please you know don't take this as any offense I don't like solar panels I feel that they're part of still what Edison's idea was I don't feel like they're really in line with what Nikolai Tesla really wanted to do with alternative current we get into the whole
 Tesla and what Edison did to take Tesla down and the fact the world would probably be free by now if Tesla if Tesla wasn't basically destroyed by the media that Edison controlled in the propaganda that Edison control so I'm talking to my engineer and saying this needs to run completely with water and I don't want to use a solar anyway and he says no I'm saying we're going to use a mirror and it's going to connect to a steam engine and that's going to push the water back up.
 And I was like after like screaming at the guy I was like look if I had known physics I wouldn't have been screaming at my engineer so if we think about what we're learning in school to learn physics to learn farming I was I was talking to a friend of mine that's a rapper and super super God following spiritual super smart and I was showing her the
 some of the designs for the monasteries and some of the designs for the fully sustainable communities all the same thing and then it said bioengineering on it and she said what do you
 it's like for her bioengineering has a negative connotation and my response was isn't like farming and cooking like bioengineering at the at the simplest form like we went to we're going from like grabbing apples off of a tree to
 we put this boom in the ground oh and we can grow this and we can grow this you know we can grow this harvest right here so it's you know I want to just simplify around up the principle behind the dawn the way of thinking is
 we got all this information and all this you know these science in the scientific exploration these things that Tesla never completed these things that DaVinci never completed and we can look at all of these things and see how do we create the most primitive versions of this to create a fully sustainable ecosystem which is
 you know what covid actually helped us to you know get closer to our families get closer to our children understand like oh wow that you know that was mapped out for us to be 50 minutes away from our home and our kids school to be 30 minutes away and put us in traffic for that
 amount of time and these cities have been designed to promote industry and just to make more money they haven't been designed to promote happiness so we're at this paradigm shift in our existence you know it was when when Muhammad hit the market I think that's who it was and brought money because before
 slave and trade and this is something you know dishonorable men honor money I got this bar from Dave she pail I'm not trying to like still is bar and you know we as human beings this this race on earth have like been honoring money and you know money isn't
 not even real you know saving back by anything I don't want to like go too far into that but when you on program yourself you see that there's other forms of currency now like relationships are a more important currency the money itself and that's what we really saw it's like the end of the movie that our existence would be pre covid post covid and so as the Titanic is crashing and sinking and Rome is falling
 there's got to be this new civilization like the end of tron where everything starts to light up and it's been under this like dark clouds so you know God is using me and he has a calling you know in my life to make the world better for all people like people say is bad people there's good people know there's there's people that are possessed that have demonic ways but we were all children one at one time say some people know they were born bad you got a
 remember like say others bad people even even the devil's an angel a fallen angel a lost angel like loss angiolus if you think let me but that's a city of angels let me let me let me start from the beginning so you you essentially deconstruct things so when you say in many ways when you're describing yourself as a visionary this is what I'm saying is you you're looking at all the systems that are in place whether it's the record industry
 the contracts that are wrong with artists the civilization is set up I think vision is to a glossy and to saucy of a title okay whatever engineer you're deconstructing all these things and you find flaws in the systems so all these systems whether it's the music industry system whether it's the political system whether it's the system of gathering food whether even a religious system like I remember when you started doing your Sunday service
 and my friend was like what is he doing I go it's making going to church cool again like you don't think that's like look at all these people having a great time you have thousands of people that are chanting and singing along like he's not asking for anything I go look if anybody should be doing something like that it's him I go because he's making great music everybody's having a good time and what do you get out of that the best thing to people ever get out of church is sense of community a time when you get together and you all agree this is where you're going to concentrate on the music and you're going to do a lot of things and that's what you're doing.
 You're going to concentrate on goodness you're going to concentrate on on trying to find these shared values that are going to help the community now you're doing this in this mass form you got the superstar musician who's doing this in this mass form with thousands and thousands of people in these gigantic areas like that's nothing but positive so you deconstructed the idea of how how to do a religious service but make it cool and now you're thinking about deconstructing all these different things you're thinking about deconstructing how you're doing this and you're thinking about the
 how food is harvested you're thinking about deconstructing how we make energy you're you're literally trying to deconstruct and and reimagine the idea of civilization yeah exactly so we talk me through how this starts with you have you were you always religious your whole life
 yes I was and then I you know then I hit high school so but you know when you're a young man and you're you know you're a superstar musician and you know you live in a wildlife what what was it that led you back to this just a feeling in your life that there was more to life there was more to your position there was more to you know this idea of a calling that you felt like you could do more.
 And that it resonated with you more to to to produce these Sunday services and to to start thinking of of life in this way like you can improve things.
 Yeah God knocked me off my horse God like literally call me and said okay now I need you I need you right now I need I mean that that God needs needs me we need God but he called me to serve him
 and I was tired of serving the music industry start tired of serving you know filling up stadiums you know the last concert last tour I did we had a floating stage and and actually was a hanging stage but it looked like it was floating and that's just another thing that's illusion where we need to dispel the illusion I wouldn't even call it the floating stage date but the whole thing about is people used to say how I lose money on tour
 because I would put so much into the creative and I and I was like wanted to prove but prove to who you know prove to man prove to greedy people you know that I could make more than anybody and that's like the gladiator position that all artists are put into like we're in the middle of this coliseum
 let me show you I can kill more lions and tigers and bears and people and both of them than than any other gladiator that happens so that's what I'm that's what I was doing and then I remember talking to James to rail and I was like at the top of my lungs like screaming about saving
 saving ourselves in humanity and the reason why me and James needed to connect and then I went to my show and then it's like my like this like my head popped back in the spirit jumped down and felt like it was like my mom talking and the last thing I said was this thing is over and I'm saying it like I sound like my mom like Donda like that's something she would have said
 if she was in the physical form when she sees her son you know exhausted like I just went through a I had this fashion show we had this fashion show where we took over msg and just broke all boundaries so 20,000 16,000 seats and played the new album and it was you know a thousand black people in the show and yeah like all the young thug plugging in the iPhone and
 Travis and cutie dancing at 50 cent there Jay Z there Lamar Odom the first time that people you know saw him in walk again was we walk together into the into the stadium and he's camo easy jacket all I had to tell and the reason why I was so important is like when he was in a coma I would come by and play him the new music and once he was out of the coma he said that he
 remember that music when he was in a coma and that was the album I was playing that day so that's the reason why me and Lamar walked in together and then the next few months later I did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late and the media they just killed me they
 they lebronned me as I would say like when Lebron went to Miami and they said you know who are you to have a choice you know like what one of my other heroes Tom Brady he left I didn't see no jerseys getting burned like when Lebron left so then less than a week after that my wife is robbed in Paris and so I was like I was going to go to the
 we we just because I'm I'm in the middle of tour while I'm doing the fashion show while I'm doing this so we cancel the tour because it's it's very you know traumatic and then you know we start the tour back up and we get back into it and then I just
 keep on saying I want to go to Japan I just want to go to Japan because Japan is like a way that people treat there isn't like this systemic racism embedded and every single
 individual that's inside of the place like in America a black white anything there's a systemic white white supremacy like when I tag you know white supremacy or we say this it's like the yes that is
 America that is the world currently we've been taught that my first superhero was Superman you know and my dad was a black panther but you know when
 Disney makes black panther now when you look it up you don't see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a mic out of somebody's hand while they're lying I don't know you know like father like son right there but you see this character
 that's made for black people to idolize that was designed by a white white person and put out by a white company so it's controlling the narrative to say we're going to show you Harry Harry
 a tough man we're not going to show you not Turner and they do every chance they get Maleficent
 they called her her race of people the moors and the moors are and I just saw it again I was just like yo if you erase our history like most black people we don't know where we come we think we came from slaves we don't know our bloodline and we're we're giving black history month and we take that like it's some gift to us know it's a programming to us racism doesn't end and
 till we get to a point where we stop having to put the word black in front of it because it's like we're we're putting the rim a little bit lower for ourselves like it's when I say I'm the second
 wealthy as black man in America like why do I have to say that because you know obviously if we just go on wealth period of what we call wealth like financial wealth that score card you know I'll be like I'm the
 78th wealthiest man in America but we shouldn't have to have a special box a special month because also what they show in black black history month is us getting holes down reminding us that we were slaves like what if we had remember when I cheated on you month like remember when you first found the
 found the text messages remember how does that make you feel it makes you feel depleted and defeated you know it's no matter what religion you are what we can agree on as it is always now but now is the shortest moment of our life it's gone in an instant the longest moments of our life are our memories and our
 imaginations think about how long a kid imagines Christmas before I mean versus how long Christmas really is and when you think back to your Christmas are you under the table like Jim
 Kerry and eternal sunshine for the spotless mind like under a chair or are you a giant are you a king are you what black what what black history month has told you you are and this is me speaking to you know black people specifically in America that
 you know I know people who would you know kill someone in or have a gunner you know in their own hood and be afraid to go downtown and literally be like afraid of white people like the most gangster gang of gangsters wouldn't go downtown and that's just a programming but that program is inside of the curriculum it's an instant
 inside of the media it and it and it goes to this whole idea of yay when people say is Jay crazy is Jay a narcissistic is Jay a ego maniac is Jay self-absorbed of Jay all these no you know who you is I know who I am and I'm not
 fit I'm not fit to bow to to an idea that you want to have me I am going to be the full idea that God has of me and when I do things that are that God don't like I'm I'm I'm being the lesser version of me this is where you know in my weakness God becomes strong I have to be the higher me
 when when people are downing me it's not like me fighting fire fire me attacking or as you say like you know stooping to
 uh stooping to that level it's like the devil will use you against you you become your own uh you become your own worst enemy I not just went on a riff right there but the thing is these isn't that what you do look at
 one of the things that I when when anybody ever talks about you to me they they say well he's all over the place and I say I think that he's got a different power source like if you look at the way everybody interfaces with the world is if there's a universal power most people have like a 20 watt charger the way I describe you I say I think that
 motherfucker's got like 150 watt charger and these ideas are just coming at him so you do go on these rants that sometimes need to be dissected into individual things but overall you're
 incredibly productive so my question is why do why do people think there's something wrong with you yeah this is but I
 literally legitimately like you've been medicated they've they've put you away right they brought you to me how did that happen
 well I'll say these two things I think very three dimensionally I don't think in the black and white lines that I've been program to think in and I think in full color so when I talk I have to
 describe a thought in five ways you know we we enjoy food that has multiple seasoning in it we enjoy music that has multiple instruments so when I
 talk it's not a rant is a symphony yes of ideas and when you collect them you say all these are all these things that connect yeah you know I I just tell the truth
 and telling the truth is crazy and a world full of lies that's simply it but no other things you're saying are crazy no
 things you said are crazy it's fascinating the way you think right because I can see that you're thinking in
 all these different layers and you're looking at things from all these different perspectives and they all come together out of your mouth and like a tornado of ideas
 now if someone wants to just have a conversation with you back and forth I could see whether they're going to go that's crazy it just doesn't stop
 just ranting but what I'm seeing is just you're a very thorough thinker you're thinking it things independently but you're thinking
 of things in a massive perspective now who convinced you that that's bad is it have you always been this way or were you less is it was it less
 manageable before did you have issues with it before yeah I believe before I found Christ and gave my life to God I would try to lean on my own
 understanding and that's the universe is like a black hole of information would you be by your own understanding meaning when people as Einstein said
 you're the smartest person what would you like to know he his it's Einstein's response was I'd like to understand the mind of God
 meaning God is all knowing and we can only know or see and for me as a visionary we can only know or see what God allows us to see and what he feels we're ready to see and understand
 to maximize what our mass laws hierarchy and each heart is you know what sets our dopamine what sets our serotonin's off what makes us feel good
 basically like you know we we did a good deed and it's like it was somehow we're you know you know just doing a beat for a famous per just doing a beat for a local dope wrapper really meant a lot to me when I was 14 years
 so doing a beat for just any one famous that had a major record deals a lot to me at age 19 me being able to you know put out my own music and put my own I was a lot to me at age 24
 meaning as I grow God sets new stages in the game of life for me that you get your satisfaction like my as well as hierarchy and need is like our satisfaction chart what makes us feel
 whole and accomplished as a as a as a human being so as I go through these different levels there's times where I would use confidence when I knew what I was doing and I would use arrogance when I didn't know what I was doing but I'd rather use arrogance than to let someone
 diminish my idea myself because that is what keeps us going hope actually keeps us alive anybody as most people is like do you want tomorrow to come and they say yes they have they have hope for it but I went from having confidence and arrogance to having faith and faith is the opposite of fear and that created this fearless approach that I have and that's what made now has made me the fearless leader that I am that I've like
 crystallized into the leader that my mom always knew I would be when kids follow me in preschool the leader that people saw when we change the sound of music the leader when we change the the sneaker industry the leader and what we're doing with with farming and with with shelters when I was building you know the homeless shelters a couple years ago and visiting parks and and going to skip row and
 understand in the
 the dynamic and empathizing with what actual mental health issues are not someone you know telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as such like I am so that's what you felt happened to you
 like you were absolutely and you were exhausted and they labeled you as mentally unhealthy yes absolutely am I saying this right that what happened with you is
 you feel like maybe or we probably feel like that having this higher calling and recognizing this higher power was the glue that kept your thoughts together they kept your mind straight and it kept you on a righteous path.
 So instead of being scattered with all these crazy thoughts and being exhausted and being labeled manic right we talked before and you were saying that they had your medication but the medication fuck with your creativity it fucked with all kinds of things or a block my ability to channel what guy wanted me to do but we're all we're all medication right now did you use toothpaste with fluoride today it blocks your plan and they put children on it and we put
 we put our kids on it you know we would it's inside the the deodorants that we use is all these things to create like a disconnect to God to serve that it's like are you serving man are you serving the one and only master but what do they tell you when when they said that they're going to put you on medication
 what do they put you on and what what what they tell you one of my favorite things that they did is they put me on this medication that made me gain a lot of weight and I said I'm not going to take this and they said okay we got a medication you can take where you don't gain weight
 and this shows you they were trying to kill a superhero slowly trying to kill genius trying to make me not feel like I could run for president make me not feel like I can go be born and Atlanta grow up on a
 Southside of Chicago go into music go and win all these Grammys change the sound of music and the look of stage performances all that and then still end up in 53 million dollars of debt what the music industry has people going to the exact debt of the house that they think they're going to buy after the tour is over and it's and it's it's strategized as criminals all over everyone's almost accounts in the music industry it's not a safe place it's a it's a
 treacherous place so with money so these things are filled with money they're filled with people that are trying to take advantage of other people fill money bees come to honey so they put they put you on this ship because you were exhausted what did they put you on
 you know I can I can research I'm like I'm actually forgetting the exact medication that they at but what did you do you the main thing that it did is it destroyed my confidence it may be the shell of who I really am
 it like grade over my eyes it it it made me it made the Mustang that buck anymore hmm they sedated you yes yeah and they what was the the thought process behind it when you talk to a doctor about this what do they tell you was wrong with you
 they they told me I was bipolar and I remember going on TMZ and saying you know slavery is a choice and they medicated me for saying that for having that opinion and saying it out loud but as I put those contracts up I'm saying this is a choice as I you know
 you didn't mean people being abducted and brought into slavery and put into chains was a choice what you were talking about is people making decisions that would enslave them financially and enslaved their life yeah it was taken out of context and it was taken in the least charitable way and they decided to try to say look at crazy Kanye look at this shitty sand yeah then they medicate you yes
 and the media is always taking anything out of context that isn't a part of the overall narrative yeah that because there's you know my Hollywood and media has control so much of the narrative and then you had silicone valley and that's so beautiful about one of my hero Steve jobs because there wouldn't be a silicone value with silicone valley wouldn't be what it is today if Steve jobs didn't make
 information accessible like this which is still a bit control but it feels like Twitter is the the safest fleet freest mass platform to communicate on and you know it's like they mess with Jack because of that you know you know well it's still censored there's a lot of issues now but I think that's internal I think that's people that are working there that are
 working there's a lot of struggles with that today and I it's unfortunate because I do agree that it's an unbelievable way to get ideas out there yeah but it's also it's a new thing and it's mismanaged by the people that use it off it they don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it yeah every version of anything that man has made will be flawed sure and it has to go through a bunch of different steps of evolution and that's the best way to do it
 evolution and that's the has to evolve and change so why did you agree to let them do this to you why why did you agree to let them medicate you
 because if that if that look I'm crazy for sure but if someone came to me and go hey we're going to put you on some medication that medication is going to calm you down I'd be like
 well everything I do is because I'm not calm everything that I've ever done that's made me successful is because I have more energy is because I have a a wildness like I'm not
 common that down like I know how to calm myself down I can self-medicate with the exercise and meditation and marijuana a bunch of different things but I'm not gonna I'm not going to take some
 I'm not going to take some medication that removes anything that's unique.
 With you and all these wild ideas that come to your head, like very few people could string
 together these thoughts the way you're describing them today.
 If somebody asked me if there's anything wrong with him, I was like, he's fucking, he's
 filled with awesome.
 Like, what's wrong with that?
 If you can keep that together, what you just did, the way you just described reimagining
 civilization, reimagining church, reimagining the food supplies, there's nothing bad about
 that.
 This is all very interesting and very good.
 Like I would never say that's bad.
 But are you this way all the time?
 Or is there good versions of Kanye and versions of Kanye where you don't feel like you have
 a grip on these thoughts?
 You know what I love is there was some perspectives that people showed about what a true
 manic episode really looks like after I was in South Carolina.
 And this one guy was talking about his mom being in an episode and kidnapping his brother
 and, you know, like proper extreme cases.
 You know, I cried and was gut wrenched like at the, I don't even like to say out loud
 what I said on South Carolina, but the idea of, you know, I'm just trying to word it in
 a way that's really safe and covers my family.
 People saw this clip of me crying.
 Some people didn't know what I was crying about, but I was crying about that there was
 a possible chance.
 I'm just looking out a way to say this.
 I know what you're going to say.
 That there was a chance that, you know, that we didn't make, that Kim and I didn't make
 the family we have today.
 That's my most like family friendly, you know, way to word that.
 And just the idea of it just tears me up inside that I was a part of a culture that promotes
 this kind of thing.
 Like one of the major statistics on the subject of life is that the greatest advocates for
 the A word is our men from ages 31 to 37.
 And that's how old I was and I felt like I was too busy.
 My dad felt like he was too busy for me and we have a culture of that.
 And they have a child rebel soldiers that were in Africa that would be doped up and psyched
 out and made to kill their parents.
 Or well, in our culture, we're doped up and psyched out and made to kill our children.
 You know, we have to decouple the conversation of a plan parenthood and woman's choice.
 Now, so of course, I'm Christian, so I'm pro life.
 And when I go into office, I'm not changing laws because I realize we live in an imperfect
 world and an imperfect society.
 What I will be presenting is a plan A. And we've already started to work on plan A to change
 the connotation of orphanages, to change the connotation of false to care.
 And not just change the connotation verbally, but to create places that are to the level
 of the like, the Amman, Geary, and Dizzy world, how to kid.
 What is this like?
 There's so much land that this can be created and then spread across the world to orphanages
 in Africa and in China and just across the globe to create these environments that when
 there's expecting families, moms, and fathers that they feel like there's a place, even
 if they don't feel well off enough to bring another life into this world, that there's
 a place to go.
 It's a plan A because plan B and plan parenthood were planned by a eugenics that set out and
 said out loud, I'm doing this to kill the black race and to create population control.
 You know, if we, what are you saying?
 Plan B mean the pill, meaning the morning after pill.
 You know what?
 Let me plan parenthood.
 Let me, let me, let me decouple those things.
 Let me, let me talk about plan parenthood.
 Okay.
 There's, the last figure I saw is there were 210,000 deaths due to COVID in America and
 everywhere you go, you see someone with a mask on.
 With A, the A word A culture, I'll say it one time with abortion culture, there are
 1,000 black children aborted a day daily.
 We are in genocide.
 We, so more black children have died in the past since February than people have died of
 COVID and everyone wears a mask.
 So it's a matter of where are we turning a blind's eye to?
 Like the media can control a lot of times or has control what we care about.
 I even heard somebody say at one point, this is the actual sentence I heard someone say,
 Puerto Rico so played out.
 Meaning there was a time where people were caring about it and now the media says don't
 care about it but these people, it still hasn't been solved.
 The hurricane still hit the earthquakes still hitting people is still suffering from that
 and no one has really gone to fix it and when that 11 billion goes to Haiti and it doesn't
 get to the people, you know, the daily mail post a swimsuit pick or something and deters
 our energy to what we have to do collectively to help our brothers and sisters.
 You know, I look at society as one body.
 I want to just go into this riff because my thoughts are like these clouds and Mario
 brothers and I'll jump to this and I'll see another one.
 I'll jump to another one.
 It's like, oh yes, I jumped to another.
 I need to express this story.
 I believe that love will heal all and we have to look at, I believe that world peace
 is possible and I believe it's us looking at each other as a moment.
 Come in in time.
 Time is love.
 You love the things you put time into.
 That's where I'm at time is love.
 Like, this is like this intangible thing, this thing you can't grab.
 You can't just grab time in your hand.
 You can't grab love in your hand but we feel both of these things are real.
 For us to love one another, just as simple as that, like love will heal the world.
 This is what is going to take to heal the world but we have a competitive spirit.
 We like having a bad guy.
 We like having a competitor.
 What we need to do is change the bad guy, change the competitor.
 Make the competitor be the Roman era, the Roman civilization.
 Make the competitor be the Egyptian kingdom and say we're the first society, we're the
 first civilization that ever became civil because we are still just as much in the dark
 ages as medieval times or as game of thrones, you know, level, black mirror level, I know
 I went past future, other dimension for a second.
 But we kill each other.
 We kill each other on social media.
 We kill each other in high schools like in the way that we talk to each other.
 We physically kill each other in our own neighborhoods and outside of neighborhoods, you
 know, this planet, when we keep turning a blind's eye to our brothers and our sisters and
 our family, which is us as a whole, as all of humanity, then of course it's going to
 get to the point where there's, you know, homeless sleeping under, you know, a bridge
 in Calabasas.
 We ignore the homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store.
 How do you, how does this just look at that visual?
 It's a homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store.
 We have builders.
 We have people who know how to make communities.
 We have people who know how to cook and how to make food and how to, how to bring this
 food.
 People are fighting over land and not really realizing that we're not, we're not maximizing
 our resources and our existence.
 We've got genius level scientists.
 We've got people who broke, you know, people who have broken out of the chains like Elon,
 like imagine if Elon was working at GM on the third floor somewhere, you know, we wouldn't
 have electric cars, we wouldn't have that new Porsche hybrid, we wouldn't have what's
 happening with, you know, hyperloop.
 Imagine if the guy that, you know, started Airbnb was shut down or the guys who started
 Uber were shut down.
 All of these people who break away and then create the new society and the next frontier
 of where we're going.
 Well, like I've said, like it feels to me like MIT is a place that has to be funded by
 people who want to take the smartest people on the planet and make them work on the smallest
 things that won't change anything.
 And I've talked to people from MIT and I could look at this brilliant person I was talking
 from MIT and he was, he was afraid.
 Everything was fear.
 Everything was about his girlfriend's pregnant.
 And, you know, we just got a house and I don't want to do anything to change this.
 And this is like one of the most brilliant people on the planet.
 But if you mix brilliance with bravery that we can ignite something, even this conversation
 alone, can ignite the people that are going to change the world because there's people
 who have been anointed.
 You can't teach the brilliance and the anointess.
 There's people who hit the game of life and they've got something that they're going to
 do no matter what school they go to.
 They just know how to do it.
 They knew how to do it before they got here and they were going to do it.
 And these people just need to see what it looks like to overcome the smoke screens of public
 humiliation, of bankruptcy.
 I was in debt.
 The fear of loss, I lost my mom or the fear of death.
 You know, what are the fears?
 Are there?
 There's a lot of fears.
 But the thing is, when you remove, like even in the schools, you remove prayer, you remove
 God, you remove the fear of God, you create the possibility of the fear of everything
 else.
 But watch this.
 If you instill the fear of God, you eliminate the fear of anything else.
 And it's not that I am fearless.
 I am definitely, literally, definitely shaking and in so much fear of my father, I fear God.
 And I don't fear nothing else.
 There's some power to that, right?
 Like it just has a mental management tool.
 There's some real power to that.
 Because so many people are afraid of every single little aspect of life, bills and debt
 and love and relationships.
 And if you have a higher power, and this is one of the things that I've always said.
 What's the main word that you use even for fear?
 This is the main disease that people use in politics.
 It's the main fear, is it?
 But it's the main word.
 It's the disease attacking the world.
 Because it destroys your, it changes your posture.
 It changes your idea.
 Worry.
 Yeah.
 Worry.
 Yeah, anxiety.
 That's what it is.
 Stress.
 Like it can kill you.
 You can't be free.
 You can't be free to take chances.
 To be worried about stuff.
 Like and I, so to be able to anchor and eliminate worry and say this, I am walking in a righteous
 path and I don't have to worry about anything.
 I don't have to worry about going to jail.
 I don't have to worry about being a killer.
 I don't have to worry about bankruptcy.
 I don't have to worry about, you know.
 Emiliation, you know, because this comes, this is where smart Alec prayers can get you.
 I used to have this really smart Alec prayer.
 I said, God, deliver me from pain and then he took my mom.
 So it's hard to hurt that much, ever again.
 Create it.
 Almost like a character like Deadpool.
 I'm like Deadpool for God.
 Like there's no noise.
 There's no human noise that can, and you know, someone tried to like, there was, there
 was a friend of mine that did like a really bad move where he tried to say, I was using
 this, this, this lawyer and I was about to work with him.
 And he said, the lawyer said, he wouldn't work with you until you get my contract done.
 And I was just like, do you not know me at all?
 I'd be the type to cut off my, if I, if my hands are like this, I'll cut off my own hand.
 I come back in the room and they'd be like, yeah, what you doing here?
 I thought we tied you up.
 I'm like, and then I go just make like a Luke Skywalker, you know, you know, hand.
 And this is one thing I want to say like, and this is about to make me mad right here.
 The first time you see me get mad in the interview.
 They said that George Lucas's prequels are worse than the corporate made Disney Star Wars.
 I'll get mad at that too.
 Like, that's fucking ridiculous.
 Revenge of the Sith.
 We saw how Darth Vader was made.
 Yeah.
 Like, I watched that like 10 times doing COVID.
 Don't jump in again.
 I got the high ground.
 Those early movies were pure.
 Yeah, we're pure.
 No, no, I'm saying even the prequels are better than anything that, and I'm sorry, Disney Star
 Wars design team.
 I know you're going to like put my face up in the, you know, office and be like, forget
 cut.
 No, man, this is George.
 This is his baby.
 That thing was set in his heart to show us as children, the hero's journey.
 You know, and these, these like, how can we run it back and replay?
 Like even at Disney, you know, there's people, you know, at Pixar that have left people
 have left, you know, where they call, I forgot the exact title, but saying like every time
 as a new idea, they call it like an unproven idea.
 So they'll get this toy story 800,000 and frozen trillion before there's a new concept.
 Take a chance on.
 Yeah, they take a chance.
 And we've been, we've been programmed like when you see the, you know, the homes, the
 style of homes that I've been developing, they're far closer to the way the galaxy looks,
 the way water looks, the way our makeup and our body feels.
 We've been, we've been put into these boxes and that was, you know, due to money, they
 would do the construction and we have to be in these, these boxes and we've been stuck
 in a loop like on a Westworld.
 And so now I feel like Tandy Newton on Westworld where she had to use the people that enslaved
 her, that trapped her to make it, to make it out.
 You know, the, and it's funny when I like the box and when I'm talking about farming, I
 had a point about farming that in finish earlier.
 I hired this guy to do the A to Z concept.
 I made it plain as day, make it so everything we cook in the kitchen at the school, we
 plan it here and they would just do it to 70%.
 They'd do it to 60%.
 Earlier when I had that point, I went to this whole riff about children needing to learn physics
 and children needing to learn how to really do things and not having this separated thing.
 Like we are programmed to lock ourselves in a box and what's amazing right now is the
 opportunity and the platform that we have that the world is hurting for everyone, for
 those that are in power, for those that are inside the program, even those that are
 in power are still a part of the program.
 And you know, I read this tweet that someone said, I finished watching Netflix, what's next.
 And that's so true that we can't even program enough to satisfy ourselves.
 The program is done.
 Forest Gump has stopped running and just turned around.
 It's like all of this thing is a set up.
 The concerts that musicians go to where we don't, you know, we're not thinking about the
 fact that we're not getting the lion's share of our masters because we're making the money
 on tour and then tour has girls and tour has the arena singing your song.
 I need you right now.
 Did you do good, champ?
 You know, like Floyd Mayweather is such a hero of mine and so excellent because he is
 a champion, right?
 But then also he wasn't afraid to say, I do my deals, I make my money.
 And what I like is, you know, he didn't let the older system tell him how to spend his
 money or how to show his money.
 It was up to him because he's his own king.
 You know, God is the king of us all but he's his own king.
 And a lot of times in America we haven't seen, we haven't seen kings.
 We haven't seen the royal blood in our bone marrow and the way it comes through.
 Now we could show it in rap and the way we put our chains on, the way we dress, we could
 show in the way we play ball and things like that.
 But it's another frontier to being a king.
 Well, there's also something where you feel diminished in the fact that you know that
 your money is being stolen by people that don't deserve it.
 So if you have some record executives, if you have some people that you know have looped
 you into a fucked up deal and they're making millions while you're making thousands that
 fucks with your head.
 It just does.
 Makes you worry.
 Makes you dress.
 Exactly.
 Anxiety.
 It eats at you.
 It could drive you crazy.
 Yeah, it could drive you crazy.
 I still don't understand how they talked you into medication, man.
 I wish I knew you better back then because I would have just had you exercise.
 I would have you, I would say, so whatever he's doing, you can't do.
 You have to understand that there's different people have different amounts of energy.
 You have this ability to have these really all-encompassing thoughts where you have these
 long trains of ideas and thoughts in your head and you're implementing them.
 This is all good.
 This is a powerful thing.
 I don't think it's a negative thing at all.
 I mean, some of it comes to, you know, I'm dealing with issues that are not just, you
 know, black and racial issues.
 I'm dealing with a maverick, you know, innovator issues.
 Yeah.
 I'm dealing with, you know, just as many, you know, issues where there's walls of, you
 know, invisible walls and invisible chains as, you know, Michael Jackson dealt with as a
 black musician or urban musician where he had to go and I'm urban and he came with thrillers.
 He's like, I don't let me go get this person who directed, which is an Eastwick.
 I'm going to get a movie director and he changed, you know, movies forever.
 I'm dealing with some, some walls that, you know, people have done to hold back agents
 of change throughout history, you know, it's like the movie is here like this part, you
 know, us talking right now, maybe a scene from my life's movie.
 Like Tesla was, you know, a white guy that was a ladies man and he would be going to
 all the like fancy events and everything and like he stopped having sex at age 40 and
 said, you know, I'm going to focus on it.
 And I mean, he died.
 He died.
 Penielis at the end, you know, I'm not going to say like he turned evil, but he's trying
 to sell a bomb.
 And he had all these like answers that would change the construct of society.
 And my best example is like code act is there in a place where they can barely pull it
 together now, but they invented the digital camera and they didn't bring it to market
 because they had all this film to sell.
 But one of the things is really, you know, that's a challenge for me is, you know, I designed
 this thing, this, we call it the foam runner and we built a factory for it in Cody and
 you can make these in 25 minutes.
 And when I'm saying about design, I was talking to one of the awesome designers that we just
 got over Yeezy.
 We got like this amazing crew.
 We got guys that Nike sued us for and one of these guys I was trying to hire him for two
 years.
 He had an occupier, he had to go surf for a year in Eisen.
 And when he like, you know, does his as a CAD drawings, it's almost like one shot one
 kill.
 You know, sometimes you design stuff, you got to do it like five, eight times like his first
 one is so close to being ready to go to market because he sketches in a certain kind of way.
 And for the longest, we said, you know, let's, I'm going to say I want to get rid of laces.
 And we still have shoes we sell with laces because it's a popular shoe and people love
 this shoe.
 And it hurts me.
 I feel like Steve Jobs trying to like remove buttons off the side of the next apple.
 And one of the things that's interesting about this, if you look at most sneakers, if
 you look at you guys sneakers right now, you have a tongue, you know, and it goes this
 direction.
 This is one of the innovations about this is one reason why this one of the most important
 sneaker designs is this goes this way because it's ergonomic.
 And I remember putting it on and being uncomfortable with wearing it because I'm so used to
 like the way like a Jordan or something fits with my jeans.
 And I remember talking to Kobe and him talking about having to make sneakers that fit with
 jeans.
 And that was a big thing because, you know, that's what we grow up.
 We grow up where, you know, called can I jeans and Jordans or something like that.
 So, this also, I feel that just the process, when I design, I become like a three year old.
 I have to go to my gut.
 I have to forget everything I know and really focus in to what I feel like some straight
 Jedi Yoda or like, you know, if I could grab that water bottle like, like when I have
 been cool, if I just did it right now, I should have had a magnet on there that you'd be like,
 maybe like, yo, this dude's a wizard.
 So for me, you know, I, I'm going to make this shoe be $20.
 And, you know, money isn't real.
 So that means the world should be eventually free.
 So I'm going to manifest the world being free.
 My dad, he lives in a DR and he says, you know, anything that you put in the ground grows.
 So why do people still go hungry?
 And I like that in theory, but I was like, man, farming is really hard though, man, I think,
 you know, I might go hungry if I have someone to farm this food.
 And it's like, but, you know, back in the days, we, we had that skill set.
 Now we're losing these skill sets that actually we can sustain off of.
 So with this, and I love giving you guys my riffs, I'm like a human version of Instagram.
 When you look at Instagram, you look at, you know, you're looking like a hundred images
 a day.
 Well, I've got millions of images in my mind and the majority of them haven't been realized
 yet.
 There's some images that are from my memory, but I got this whole, the future that's in
 my mind that has to be brought.
 So this is, you know, we talk about hype culture and choose being sold on the, you know,
 the resale market and easy lives in that place.
 But I, you know, I don't like the idea.
 I don't love the idea that some of the reason why people buy it is just for hype culture
 or you ain't got this or I got this color way.
 You don't have it that type of mentality.
 I'm an essentialist.
 I'm a minimalist and like I have to, I will bring the fully A to Z, our existence version
 to existence like Victor Groen designed the shopping centers, but he designed full utopian
 communities and people were like, we're just cool with the shopping center.
 That's all we want.
 These ideas that he had never got brought to fruition.
 A little bit like Disney, Cannabis, Epcot Center on Victor Groen, but these, this next frontier
 of these communities and villages of happiness are way closer to a Kenyan village than it
 is to like a gay community village.
 But one of the things about your, this version, the hype culture, one of the good things
 about the hype culture is if people get into your products, they're going to get into
 you and they're going to get into your ideas.
 All these ideas that you have will become a part of their thought process.
 They'll start thinking about it and they go, hey, he's got some great points.
 If people really get into your shit, they're also really going to get into your ideas.
 I think it's one of the things that make people uncomfortable about you is you have the
 courage to have all these bold ideas and to implement them and to do all these different
 things.
 There's people and there's a lot of people that don't have that kind of courage and they
 are straddled down by anxiety and they see a guy like you and they like try to find flaws.
 They try to find things that are wrong with it.
 Instead of looking at the positive aspects of it, they only concentrate on the negative
 aspects of it.
 I don't see it that way.
 I've never sought that way.
 I look at you, look at that guy, you can fucking do anything.
 There's people like Tesla and there's people who, you know, there's a person who killed
 animals with test records to make people not like Tesla.
 The person.
 Yeah, the person who made the electric chair be made with the test records so people
 wouldn't like Tesla.
 Tesla still has inventions that haven't been brought to our society that would have brought
 more simplicity and happiness to our society.
 Like the Westinghouse ability to transmit electricity through the air, which is fascinating.
 I don't know if that would have worked in today's world with cell phones and all the
 different electronics and even, you know, modern air travel.
 I don't know.
 I don't know what it would have worked, but things would have been different.
 People are over designing into industries where they see they can make some money as opposed
 to stepping back and saying, how do we look at the entire earth as an opportunity to free
 everyone and create happiness for everyone?
 So like, there's only a billion people on the internet.
 You never think about that.
 There's seven to eight billion people on Earth, but then there's only a billion people
 that are influenced and that are on the internet.
 We feel like the internet is everything.
 It's only like 15%, you know, 18% of human beings.
 But in order to make, for our civilization, for us to survive, we have to make more human
 beings.
 We have family, we have to have food, we have to have shelter, that we don't have to
 have the internet.
 We don't have to have music.
 We don't have to have, you know, that's a conversation.
 I mean, I mean, it enhances life.
 Yeah, it enhances the quality of life is better, but look at the music.
 Look at what the information we're putting in it.
 Like I feel bad when I hear rap songs.
 I feel bad, even the stuff that, you know, I just recently put out, I was like, you
 know, how you listen to lambs, they do imitation, man.
 Like why is that's just, I don't like that message because we're all the imitation of
 our parents and imitation of this, imitation of the imitation of Adam and Eve.
 You know, we're, we're all the next versions.
 There should be the V2, V3, V4, like, you know, Michelangelo and DaVinci have the same
 teacher.
 You know, there's times where, you know, my like, people work with me or say, like, my
 mentees or whatever will go out and they'll do something that I wanted to do.
 And then I'm torn because as a man, you know, I'm jealous and I'm proud at the same time.
 And it's like a father-son relationship because sometimes when the, when the son goes out
 and is more successful at things, the father wants to say, that's a good job.
 But every time the son does something as a good job, it reminds the father of his failures.
 Yes.
 So it's just, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a strong dynamic that that's where I have to
 lean on God to not be like, you know, this, this like prick that's jealous of, you know,
 people who are innovating or taking, you know, the, the, the goal line because we got to
 realize we're in a relay race of humanity.
 At a certain point, whoever, you know, what, what the inventors in the, in the past,
 it is now handed over to the inventors today, they're handed over to the next inventors.
 The good thing about the walls and the perception and all that is this like smaller, bigger
 to entry allows there to be, you know, a Walt Disney and a Steve Jobs and a Henry Ford.
 So what I'm doing right now, there's a, there's a, there's a real barrier to entry to
 doing, to constructing homes and communities and farm.
 Like you can't, you can't just do it like how you can just, you know, it's hard for someone
 to go from, I'm not saying it can't happen.
 I'm just saying that it's difficult for someone to go from, you know, programming and
 putting their music out on the internet today to what it was that Michael Jackson had to
 do.
 And I think he was so hard for him.
 I mean, he was, since he, this guy was the leader of the Jackson five when he was five,
 like his entire life led up and this is what he focused on.
 And it made, and it was all focused on that.
 So it made the great Michael Jackson now.
 All right.
 I want to do this comparison of Disney, Steve and a, Henry Ford and what easy is.
 It's really hard to make houses.
 It's a, it's like a corrupt industry also.
 You got contract, how many times have you started on a house and contractors like start
 overcharging for stuff and the budget ends up being twice the amount and twice as long?
 Look, if you had a relationship, this is why relationships are a better currency than
 money.
 If you had a relationship with the contractors, if you were part of their family, your
 house would be done quick.
 I feel like it's a practical joke on rich people.
 How long houses take to bill.
 I was in the airport and there was a first class line that was super slow and there was a
 coach area with like eight openings and there was no one in it.
 And then I hopped out and it's other gentlemen hopped out with me and went through that line
 and we went through.
 But the rich people with the Hermanns belts didn't want to lose their position so bad that
 they would rather wait in the first class line than to have the time back and go to that.
 Now this gentleman is a surgeon that works on people's hearts through their feet.
 So it's like that kind of engineer, surgeon, doctor, mentality is like, yeah, I got money
 because this is what I'm doing.
 But I'm here to serve and I have a mentality that I'm not better than the person that's
 in coach, which is the reason why we were the only two that went through that.
 How do you segue off of this when I just go into this?
 How do you even find a question?
 What are you thinking over there right now?
 There's no reason to worry about it.
 Do you have a rigid process that you organize your day with?
 How do you seem to have so many different thoughts and so many different things going on simultaneously?
 How do you organize your day?
 Do you have ritual?
 Do you have things?
 I drive my children to school, drive my kids to school, and I stay at school with them
 all day.
 And I'm in the kitchen working with the top chefs on the planet to create these healthy
 menus and I'm working with the farmer.
 So the school that I'm at is also, it's like this new, I don't want to know just respect
 the NASA, I was going to say new NASA, but of humanity that we're anchoring it around
 our children.
 That's what my day consists of.
 But then I also, in the past couple of months, have been going to Atlanta for two days
 a week or three days a week because I'm building this 120,000, oh, I'm not supposed to say
 that I'm building.
 We're building a sound stage.
 But it was funny because I go back and forth on content.
 Should I work in content?
 Should I work in tech?
 I have all these website ideas and tech ideas.
 And sometimes I was like, I'll say, I'm cursed by tech.
 I'm not, you know, I don't have any curses or God has, let's me break the curses and
 break the chains, I'd rather say.
 I don't know if content is my calling, like messaging, like let me show you what a school
 of the future looks like.
 Let me show you a monastery of the future.
 Let me show you the farms of the future.
 Look like, but we're 20 years past the future.
 Like, it's in 2020.
 Like we're supposed to be in a future by 2000.
 So it's my job to pull the future into now.
 And that's something I struggle with when I talk about the different things that I'm doing,
 getting into the idea of doing like content for Netflix or content for Hulu and like, what
 that content because I believe we're in the movie.
 I believe we're in the game.
 We're in like, Grand Theft Auto.
 It's just too many things that align.
 And we're in that, we can terraform.
 What we can do is be like, if you're a Grand Theft Auto character, just start redesigning
 the world, his self, like painting his own, his own world.
 We have this opportunity to make life as fun as the second life.
 But if you look at how politics, just general unhappiness, misery, control, the speed that
 contractors go, the farmers that wouldn't finish the farm, the way we are with each other,
 is why people feel like, look, everyone's going to go into like this Ready Player One
 second life.
 And I believe that our first life can be just as imaginative.
 And it will be.
 So that's my, and I have a bunch of friends that work in the gaming industry and I have
 friends that work in the content industry.
 And I'm saying, I'm anchoring on real life to make real life as awesome as games, to make
 real life as awesome as movies.
 So did I answer the question of my schedule every day?
 Yeah, but I mean, so you just basically go on what you feel like working on.
 You basically just start your day, you do your stuff with your kids and then whatever
 these ideas you have, you just nourish them.
 You just encourage them.
 You just feed whatever thoughts are in your head.
 Yeah, but what I was expressing on that, on that last symphony I gave you was, this
 was that I do have this challenge.
 That's where I'm designing.
 I'm actually designing what I'm doing with my time, saying, should I be even taking a
 meeting, like when I take a meeting, this, how I know if it's a good or bad meeting, if
 someone's talking to me and I just get sleepy, I know.
 That's not what I should do, but if someone's talking to them, you know, energize.
 I like saying the word energize over the word excited because this is what they do to,
 this is what they do to all of us.
 They get excited and anxiety kind of go together like, someone could say, hey, I got you a
 new car and it's across the street.
 And you get so excited, you run across the street, get hit by a car, trying to run to your
 new, but if you're energized about having the car, perhaps you look both ways.
 I play this dictionary game with the, like this, the small website pocket dictionary.
 And we'll go to a page and say go to page with the word help on it.
 And we say highlight all the words you think are positive.
 And then we talk about afterwards, why do you think that's positive?
 So the word help is like, it's like a, it's like a bad leg on a table.
 You think you could stand on it, but if you stand right there, that table could flip over.
 The fourth definition in the word help is to ignore and it actually makes sense.
 You know, like if you have a meeting, right, here's the answer when you know the meeting
 didn't do good, didn't go well.
 The person says it then, oh, how can I help?
 That means they don't want to do nothing.
 They'll just give you a phone number.
 You know, the word is to ensure.
 And then there's a lot of words to end with you are, that are very powerful, future,
 pure, endure.
 And that goes into like the rhyme, like, because I'm literally trying to figure out the video
 game at all times.
 Let's see where these things are parallel.
 I know this can get into like a riff where people like, okay, yeah, you were losing what
 you're saying right now.
 But, but look at that.
 Look at the dictionary.
 Look at these words.
 I have friends that English is their second and third or eighth language.
 And they say that English is the hardest language to learn because there's so many words
 to, to, that mean the same thing.
 It, like, it tears me to my core that my daughter has to learn T.W.O, the difference to T.W.O,
 T.O.O and T.O.
 I want to just be like, just draw the number two.
 Like, just make it like, I sometimes I don't know when, you know, the different.
 I'm like a terrible speller.
 And I believe that there's like curriculums that are, that are European curriculums that
 don't even apply to our genes, you know, who we are as the people like African descent.
 People, we don't even talk like that.
 Like, this is a skill set, but I'm still talking white basically.
 Like, you'll see like a black pastor, you know, give this amazing like sermon or like
 Mary's someone was a wedding and this guy, they said, well, he speaks so well.
 What do you mean, well, he speaks super white.
 Like, yeah, that's what the definition of well, right, right.
 It just sounds you using to communicate ideas, right?
 Well, this funny, I bumped into a friend of mine.
 I actually met Williams that said, Givenchy, I wasn't expecting to see, I wasn't expecting
 to see him.
 I wasn't expecting to see him.
 And we're at the Mercer lobby and he called me off guard.
 And I was like, I didn't use words when I, when I, when I saw him, I like almost communicated
 in a different language, like a language of like joy or happiness.
 Only 30% of our communication is, is verbal.
 That's why the mask just really throw me off because I can't tell what someone is thinking
 and feeling because a lot of times, half time, people don't say what they're thinking
 and feeling.
 You don't have to decode with the mask.
 I can only hear what they're saying.
 That's the problem with social media too, right?
 Yes.
 Things in black and white and things being taken out of context.
 I mean, that's the reason why people, like, you know, love this show that they're like,
 oh, we got the yay.
 Joe Rogan, we can hear him go into all of these riffs.
 Yeah.
 And we can feel him.
 You can see, you know, how I'm looking.
 You can see my energy in the way I'm saying it too.
 Yeah.
 And you see people sitting down having an actual conversation, a real conversation.
 Yeah.
 And a conversation where anybody that comes on this show, you don't have like this, like,
 sometimes with reporters, they have like, people that are media, they have like a complex.
 You don't have a complex.
 You're like, yo, let's first off get this straight.
 Like if I, like, I could whip your ass.
 I'm Joe Rogan.
 I'm a professional fighter.
 Now let's start the conversation, which I think is another reason.
 Like with Nick Cannon, he's like, man, I'm Mary Mariah Care.
 I did all these.
 And both of these interviews have been very positive because people aren't carrying something
 already, like, some form of chip on their shoulder where they got to like, every sentence,
 sometimes I talk to reporters, it's like they're saying the thing they wanted to say to this
 guy in high school that they never got to complete the conversation.
 And they're taking it out on me.
 I'm like, yeah, I think there's a lot of people that have conversations.
 When people and they want to create a viral moment too, that it's not just a conversation.
 They have an agenda.
 It's almost like you were talking about the Disney Star Wars movies that then it's not
 a work of art.
 It's a formula, like two plus two is four.
 Let's put those together.
 We'll make some money.
 Instead of the original Star Wars, which was the hero's journey, which was like a Joseph
 Campbell book, it's like there's a beauty and a purity to it.
 It's an expression.
 If someone comes up with an idea and they bring it to fruition and then you get to watch
 and you're like, wow, it moves you.
 The new movies don't move you.
 And it was a crew of leaders, of thought leaders that like, as a Brian DiPomo that told George
 to put the words at the beginning, because it's like, you really, I've been feeling like
 it's like when I talk up to this point, I've just been making THX.
 Then the toys from Star Wars have now come out first, which would be like, you know,
 like the Yeezies or something like that.
 And now some making the whole Star Wars in real life like backwards.
 Like the product came first, kind of like Disney.
 Like Disney, he was Mickey Mouse became super popular before he was able to get all of
 his Imagineers, Imagineers in.
 I want to point out, you know, when people talk about being, you know, self-absorbed or
 the center of your own universe, what's the main character in Star Wars name?
 Luke Skywalker.
 Who created Star Wars?
 George Lucas.
 But did he write it?
 But listen to that last name.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 George Luke.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 He's the main character in Star Wars.
 He can't stand Saster.
 That's it.
 It was awesome.
 Yeah, there's something about things that are pure, right, versus things that are attempting
 to recreate something that people are going to like.
 There's a difference.
 And it's in music as well, right?
 Like, your music resonates with people because it's obviously coming from your mind.
 Whereas some people are creating songs that they think are going to be hits.
 They're creating top 40.
 It's coming from my heart and my gut, but when it's the most pure, it's coming from God
 and I'm being used as a channel.
 It's like when Tonya Hardin hit the triple flip, you know, she had all that skill and then
 at some point, it's not called a triple.
 I'm out of words.
 I'm about to say triple Lindy like is Rodney Dangerfield or something, but it's like,
 there's these moments where we do things that are seem like superhero level.
 And I think that's what M. Knight Shaliman was laying out for us with unbreakable glass
 and what was the other one with the guy with the multiple personalities.
 It's just like he's got three of these films that are like showing us, hey, you're super
 heroes.
 You can believe it.
 The greatest disableer of our abilities, our greatest, our greatest kryptonite is doubt.
 Right.
 You know, out in fear.
 Yeah, doubt.
 Like why did I, you know, like going to why did I register so late to run for president?
 COVID.
 Like, I remember like I had, I had the virus and I was sitting, you know, quarantine in
 my house and my cousin texted me about being prepared to run for president.
 And I just completely pulled, like put it off to the side because I was like shivering
 and, you know, having a shake to take a hot shower or eating soup and, you know, just
 stepping out of it.
 I don't think it was that bad.
 I think it was a mal case.
 And it just threw off, I mean, threw everyone off, it threw everybody's plans off.
 And then, you know, it was just this calling on my heart.
 And I remember talking to like really like elitist, you know, writers, you know, I was trying
 to avoid saying white supremacist, but like elite, like the liberal elites are like, you
 know, so boy, who are you going to vote on?
 You know, like who were you to run for office?
 And why would you sign up for office, you know, if you can't even get on ballots, that's
 people are saying that to me.
 And I could get on the ballots.
 It's like there's black mothers that go into hospital and the doctor will tell them that
 there's something wrong with their child to get them.
 So this is happening to this date.
 And then when people say, you know, are you a pawn like for the Republicans, the reason
 why I think that people are asking me that is because the Democrats do create black
 pawns.
 They do have celebrities that they'll sit down and meet with and say, you're going
 to be an advocate for the Democratic Party and, you know, everyone's like, you know,
 and I'm not trying to take any sides of like Republicans or Democrats.
 I'm just saying why were people so much thinking that I was like a form of a pawn?
 And then the idea that, you know, liberals would say like, the funny thing is liberals, I
 think, and I'm, I don't know if I could classify myself as liberal, but I'm definitely kind
 of liberal elite.
 I wrote my beautiful dark twisted fantasy like I've had some of the best writings.
 So that would put me in that class, so to say, but I'm also just a, a pureist.
 Like I see a Kenyan home and be like, that's beautiful right there.
 I'm not like, I got to have the, so the one of the most racist things that liberals
 who pride themselves on that being racist have said to me is like, you're going to split
 the black vote.
 And that makes it seem like black people can't make decisions for ourselves and that
 don't know why people know me.
 Like I'm only liberal.
 They literally make it seem like only black people will vote for me.
 Think about that statement, the nuance of institutionalized racism.
 And this would be like somebody from the art world, you know what I mean?
 They just have a place where no one has really been able to embrace the idea of blacks not
 being in a block and staying in one place or blacks having to vote Democrat.
 Yeah, or blacks having opinion like us not being on boards or us being like handlers for
 other black people meaning like if we work at a label, we work at a big corporation, it's
 our job to go talk to the other black people, you know, to calm other black people down,
 but we're working for, you know, universal or vivendi or whatever the organizations were.
 You know, I was thinking about buying my masters and I realized that that was too small of
 a thought.
 I'm going to buy universal.
 Now, only a $33 billion organization.
 I'm one of the greatest product producers that ever existed.
 I'm and I'm a child.
 I'm 43 years old.
 I was $53 million in debt, you know, four years ago.
 And now it's proven that I'm the new Michael Jordan of products.
 I went to a Deedas and we were a $15 billion organization losing two billion before COVID hit
 or a market cap was 68 billion.
 I went to the gap and our partner with the gap and our stock jumped 45% in two hours.
 The organization made $2 billion and two hours.
 And now we've doubled.
 I mean, the gap was, Mark Cap was lower than Yeezy.
 It was like $3 billion when I first got there.
 Now it's like $78 billion and we haven't even released a product yet.
 But what I loved, I sat there and I did the deal without getting on the board and I looked
 at my cousin and I didn't want to sign the deal without being on the board.
 And I looked at him and said, I'm doing this for you.
 Meaning like, this is part of a relay race.
 So just be a given that if someone of color was to your position, my position of influence
 will be on the board.
 But Michael Jordan had to break down walls and Michael Jackson had to break down walls
 for us to break down the next walls.
 And the next walls are the boardroom because you know what the boardroom is?
 It's an opinion.
 People are fine for us to play basketball and you know, rap and make clothes.
 But the society as a setup is not really used to or fine with us actually having an opinion.
 And I can understand why because what is our opinion based on if we grew up thinking
 we were slaves.
 If our opinion isn't based on hey, my dad taught me how to run this company.
 You know, my dad is smarter than me and everything he wanted to do, black people thought he
 was crazy and he had to do it with white people who thought he was incompetent because
 he was black.
 And the way these companies and the way the music industry, the way managers and the way
 society generally looks at black people is the way like a massage and anistic man looks
 at a hot lady.
 What can you give me?
 What can you do for me?
 No one, the massage and anistic man like don't look at a hot lady and say, can you run
 my company?
 So you know, this idea of me, you know, and I got like, you know, I'm building my factories
 I've simplified the design and I was working with a guy that you know, that's helping
 me to, you know, build some of the factories.
 It was an older white gentleman and he just matter of factly says we're sitting at his
 house in Malibu.
 It's a nice day.
 He just matter of factly says Adidas will never put you on the board.
 And I'm like, this, this wall has to come down like, how could you not have the guy that
 has the best ideas?
 So one of the great things with universal, one of the approaches that we have is, you
 know, universal when Jimmy Iveen and Dr. Dre, so beast by Dre, universal had a chance
 to buy in or do different things.
 They sold it for $3 billion that was half of the value of universal at that time of $6 billion.
 Due to the internet, which the music industry was afraid of in 2000, universal now I think
 is worth $33 billion.
 And now they have another Steve Jobs, you know Howard Hughes, Henry Ford, Disney, Elon,
 kind of character within their midst.
 But they're so concerned about the control of the idea of artists because they're using
 me as like this artist that has attracted other artists.
 Also I used them.
 I got famous, made some money, I got the tour, you know, I became this superstar so we
 use each other.
 Now there's just an adjustment that needs to be made in the relationship.
 And I can make and I will make products that will make more money the universal is worth.
 But it's not about the money as I said earlier.
 It's about the fact that even though my net worth is $5 billion and I'm one of the most
 famous, most influential God fearing Christians on the planet, the I still have to go to this
 man or this organization and ask him for something.
 And that is what is about you can have a company, right?
 When you go and do your companies, don't think as you got the most ownership that you actually
 have the control.
 If you don't have the information and the knowledge of how the distribution works and you're not
 having that conversation, you don't have the control.
 So what I did in my organization with universal, with gap and with the deities, I told my lawyers,
 my managers, everything, no one can communicate with these organizations except for me.
 They couldn't give me advice, but they got a talk to the boss, which is me.
 And right there, you start to get the information flow.
 Guess who's my CFO?
 Who?
 Me.
 So that means I do 10 to 15 transactions.
 What I do is I pay because I had open credit cards.
 I had checks.
 I had people flying in and out.
 I had a consultant agreement.
 People who weren't on the salary, but they were consultants.
 I had people paying for flights, hotels, cars, food, Netflix, everything, just running
 the account.
 Just even right now, I cancel all my credit cards except for one credit card.
 This is like the Oprah Winfrey moment where she's like, man, when I started spending
 cash, I was like, I really realize how much I was spending and I'm signing all my own
 checks.
 I think that happens in the music industry.
 And just a lot of industries, people tell you that someone needs to do something for you.
 And it's like, look, this Siri, do everything for you.
 You can do it.
 It's possible.
 And it's just when you ask me, how do I delegate my time?
 It's important for me to delegate my time.
 If I made $210 million last year, and yeah, I have a lot of Maverick ideas I'm working on
 cities and homeless shelters and farms and I'm reinvesting myself.
 So a lot of Mavericks will spend their money on their ideas and they'll invest in what
 they see the future is.
 And I ended up with a net worth of $10 million.
 I remember a month ago, people were like, you can't show your taxes because people
 won't understand that you're a billionaire if they see that you only net it $10 million
 last year.
 And after the gap deal happened, my net worth went from $3.3 billion to $5 billion.
 And I had been asking the people around me to run the story and they were going to run
 it with Bloomberg.
 They never ran it.
 I was not afraid of people looking at me like I was not a billionaire.
 And I said, be honest, show my taxes, show everything.
 And then the reports came back, oh, you're worth $5 billion.
 It came from me just being honest.
 When I want to say something about the gap deal, also specifically the name, the gap in
 my journey with that.
 At age 16, I worked at the gap.
 I always saw the gap as being the apple of a peril.
 I always had this comparison with Steve Jobs.
 I always felt like I was the Steve Jobs of the gap.
 It was something about how clean it was and what Mickey Drexler had done and all these commercials.
 Like, at age 16, I was working at the gap and I got fired for stealing.
 And I was actually stealing khakis.
 I was stealing khakis from my friend.
 Funny thing, look, I stole khakis from my friend.
 When I started doing music at age 19, 18, I went and bought a chain.
 I came home one day, didn't see what the chain was, come to find out.
 My friend was smoking crack and it stole my chain.
 So the guy I was stealing for, end up stealing from you.
 For me, but khakis, I was still in some khakis.
 I wanted those khakis that bad.
 So then 27 years later, I give my life to God and I start doing Sunday service.
 One of the things that I had to do for Sunday service, or I got to do that was fun for
 me to do, was to design the wardrobe for Sunday service.
 And we would redesign t-shirts.
 And it says in the Bible that Jesus wore seamless garments.
 We started building t-shirts with the seam was only here or only two seams on the shirt
 or moving it around.
 And what the neck was.
 And I made t-shirt after t-shirt after t-shirt.
 And Christianity, we say we stand in the gap.
 So watch this.
 This opportunity is presented.
 And I always had clothes that were kind of chill like they could be at the gap.
 They were not overly fashionable.
 And God said, you stood in the gap.
 And I'm not how you stand in the gap for real.
 And I'm going to give you favor and increase.
 And I know some person, I know somebody with all that design and t-shirts will come in handy.
 I literally was designing t-shirts for Sunday service like David working out in the field,
 tending to the field.
 You know when Goliath came, they wanted one of his brothers and the warriors to go up
 against Goliath and his father chose David.
 And David said, I don't need all this armor.
 I just need these three smooth stones.
 I just need, you know, this is how I got this.
 They didn't know David had to fight a lion and had to fight a bear.
 So God, by him, tending to the field and humility and in service to God and honor to his family,
 he was able to have the skill set to take down Goliath.
 We hit the street, you know, it's a term that I had to learn.
 Wall Street, we hit the street like you never ever saw it before.
 I used to be in San Fran, asking people to invest in me, nobody invested me.
 When I went to a wedding in San Fran, with all these billionaires and investors, angel investors,
 you should have seen people's faces.
 They were like, you jumped from the three point line.
 You ran a stock by 45%.
 You see, think about this.
 You're going to split the black folk.
 You can't vote for this.
 You're only a rapper.
 You're only, it's like all these things that diminish me.
 And now it's like Deadpool.
 Like I came back as like a superhero.
 And I won't let that be the kryptonite.
 I won't let my own ego be my kryptonite.
 I won't let other people's opinions be my kryptonite.
 I won't let these labels that people put on me be my kryptonite.
 And a lot of times I don't like to watch these interviews back until about three, four,
 five years later because I'm always, you know, I'm visiting the now.
 I'm existing in the future and visiting the now when I'm speaking to you.
 And they make a lot more sense in the future because I can tell you, but he can show you.
 God can show you a lot of stuff I'm telling you.
 And some people are following me.
 Some people are believing in it.
 And some people are just doubting it because they want to put this label all.
 He's crazy or it's just a black guy saying it or it's just a rapper.
 It's just a, it's just an entertainer.
 It's just whatever it is.
 So I can say the most wild ideas out loud.
 It's like Veronica Cornenstone wanting to be an anchor person.
 And remember she says, Ron, I told you I wanted to be an anchor.
 He said, yes, I heard you.
 I wrote it down. Veronica Cornenstone had a very funny joke tonight.
 And every time I talk, it's like Veronica Cornenstone having a very funny joke tonight.
 Like when I said, it's going to run for president.
 That was like, go ahead.
 Would you like to interject?
 Do you have thoughts and ideas also that you'd like to have be a part of your interview?
 Well, you went from, you went from people mad at you,
 they just put in the back black vote all the way to the gap and all the way to Veronica.
 I mean, but I then I brought it back.
 Yes, you did.
 To the vote to run it for president.
 I brought it back from to people doubting you and people putting limitations on you.
 People that turn in at this podcast that go on the journey with us.
 Yeah, listen, do where they don't.
 It's up to them.
 But do you know the beautiful things you're not listening to these people,
 these people that are trying to put these labels on you and tell you what to do?
 And you're not saddled down by fear.
 You're not saddled down by doubt.
 You're willing to take these chances.
 If you did become president, what would you do that was different?
 I mean, pretty much everything.
 I was just looking at the suits last night.
 I was like, yo, what would you redesign?
 I don't wear white anymore.
 They had a white shirt.
 They had a like a, I just, I would redesign this.
 I will.
 It's not a would.
 It's not a if.
 It's not a if.
 It's just when.
 We got to start with the budget.
 I feel like, you know, the fact that I went from being in debt to, to, to,
 I don't even like the way it sounds.
 The multi-bid because we think about Steve Jobs's money is like the least of what's awesome
 about him.
 And the money is just a tool like, it's like nails.
 Like I got the most nails.
 Do you feel like it's scored on the scoreboard, though?
 So it proves, it proves not just value, but it proves effectiveness.
 Yeah.
 It's like you're crazy to your right.
 So it proves in some way that a lot of the things I said that were crazy I was actually
 right about.
 Yeah, looking at that budget and I think that that's part of God's like training like Mr.
 Miyagi, paint the fence, you know, karate kid, Daniel son.
 On that I gave like the full description of the, of the analogy.
 Just a case, people didn't, what do you think you would do, though, if they come to you
 with talks about foreign policy?
 People love talking about foreign policies is the number one question.
 But when I talk about the budget, you know, this paint the fence, the fact that I had
 to, you know, that I have to understand $300 million a cash a year.
 That, you don't get trained for that.
 That's like astronaut training that I have to understand how to have multiple industries.
 That I have to understand how to build and house and provide, you know, I provide people
 with healthcare.
 And I could have, I had this idea of doing a zero employee org where I put everything
 on my partners on universal on the gap on Adidas.
 But I believe this is amazing training for me as a black person.
 Just people who, who have been raised to respect a penny.
 But as a black person, I've been raised to look down at a penny.
 But the people who really hold their money respect every penny.
 They respect the money and it's interesting.
 I had an argument with one of my managers because I made my own travel ban in my organization.
 Because you know, I did, when I did sunny service a month and a half ago, I was 25 flights
 coming in and people I didn't know.
 Because there's criminals in my organization trying to kill Bob Marley.
 Not JFK or MLK me, but deplete my resources.
 So I created the travel.
 What did explain that?
 What do you mean by that?
 What I mean by what?
 This criminals in your organization?
 Like what do you mean?
 Meaning there's people that, okay, I fired this one CFO about three months ago and up
 to a week ago, he still had an open credit card.
 Because when I dig lower and dig lower and go to it, it's like always like, is this the
 new person that's in charge of your money?
 It's like, no, I'm the new person that's in charge of your money.
 That's in charge of my money rather.
 So that's why you became your CFO.
 That's why I became, and it's the best, and it clears my thoughts.
 And it really helps me with design.
 It helps me as I'm designing what I'm doing at the gap.
 It helps me with what I'm, how I'm designing the curriculum.
 It helps me in the way I'm designing the kitchen, the way I'm delegating, the way I'm
 working, the way I'm being a better leader, being a better, being a better listener.
 Basically, but there was some question I had, I was answered and I gave it, I was before
 you went to foreign policies, I went to the budget.
 Well, I said it's like Daniel some painting the fence, the fact that I've had to really
 look at and understand that kind of money, and this God given anointing being a producer,
 being a head of industry to be a God fearing and God and a servant of God and a producer
 and head of industry at the same time is literally like the perfect combination for a president
 and to be honest, I'm literally like every now and then America has to get, America deserves
 the world deserves a leader that they can 100% trust that whatever I'm saying to you with
 the information that I have in front of me, I 100% believe that.
 Like when I talked to, when I was with the president of Haiti and he gave us an island, me
 in Shervin Pishavar that was an early angel investor at Uber and is working on the Virgin
 Hyperloop right now.
 Really great friend of mine, he saved me, he's had me avoid deals where I was going to give
 up a percentage of my company for a third of the value and different things like that.
 So we go to Haiti and the president gives us this island to develop to make a city of
 the future and also we're going to have the farmers and the people who live there take
 a percentage, I mean, take ownership of the land that they have right now.
 So when it raises value, they all eat off of what the idea is.
 But he said that the way that he has done business with our president is so straightforward.
 I believe that I know that me as president would be the best thing that ever happened for
 America's foreign policy.
 I've traveled more than any president already and I bring people together.
 I put rivals on songs together to create masterpieces.
 I go and I empathize when I meet with leaders in Africa when I meet with leaders in, I didn't
 really have a good next thing I wanted to sound good.
 I'm like, I'm a leader.
 I wanted to sound fire.
 I love to use music that.
 But when, see, honestly, so when I meet with, when I meet with leaders, I'm not sure
 about trying to go in there and see how they can use my internet.
 I'm not trying to go in there and buy up their land and develop it and buy it up for
 cheap.
 We're going to share information.
 We have an idea we just had of a dual citizenship for Americans with African descent that the ability
 to create environments and communities completely can change the way people act.
 People are hungry.
 They're going to act a certain way.
 People have food.
 They're going to act a certain way.
 People are away from their friends and family.
 They're going to act a certain way.
 They're going to need to, they're at a college town.
 They need to stop by this frat party and drink and do the, but when they're, but you
 got to go here, so then you could go there and society is all about dismantling the family.
 I see things being more like a, a, a kabut.
 So, or, you know, where the family can be as close and where the grandparents can be
 next to the children and, you know, these ideas I have about how communities should be
 are worldwide, simplified ideas and that, then that based on industry, even though I understand
 industry, they're based on serving God and serving families.
 And that's something that everyone across the globe, no matter what country in the world,
 whatever continent in the world, all of the moms and dads have something in common.
 They want the world to be better for their children.
 We all want the world to be better for the children.
 And we can show ways that we are not at odds.
 Think about the world as a giant piano, but we're playing off key.
 So, for a producer to synthesize those ideas and that's say, okay, we're going to shut,
 I spent time in China, I spent a year in China when I was in fifth grade.
 I used to speak Chinese.
 You know, like, Niaomash, hey, she, like, I don't know a lot of, yeah, my mom was an English
 professor and I had an exchange program where a Chinese student could come to America and
 she could go to, which was, there was like Chinese at that time couldn't come to America
 as easily.
 So, you know, there's America's greatest export is influence and culture.
 China actually has like imitation pairs, imitation, they probably got imitation calabases at this
 point.
 They probably do.
 At this point, you know, the artist defined culture.
 That's what makes it was an artist that made the design, the Statue of Liberty.
 There's an artist that designed the Eiffel Tower.
 This is the reason why I donated a hundred million dollars to James Torell's Rotten
 Crater project.
 When I went to, this is like the eighth wonder of the world, but I saw spaces that we
 can exist in that would be helpful for our health, our well-being.
 These are healthier places for us to be, we need to be like almost like Torellians.
 Our life is like a Shakespeare experience, like Shakespeare is written 30% of our language
 that we use.
 Like I said, like, he must have been a really nice person.
 Like, Da Vinci used to walk away from people when he would talk to people and that's, but
 that's the reason why it's the Da Vinci code and at the Da Vinci life because he never
 was able to get it across to the level to affect us for generations to come.
 These people love art, but they want to put art in the box.
 We need to surround ourselves with the artist because the artists are the most connected,
 the most truthful, and their dinosaur never got killed.
 Somehow the people who have figured out how to make a real, a living off of art is...
 What do you mean by the dinosaur never got killed?
 Everything art class would be considered to be fun.
 Like every kid loves to draw, right?
 But some people got to grow up and like the artist and some way don't have to.
 Yes.
 Like, we're all children.
 If you're alive, you're a child.
 We're all children and God's eyes and we're all young people.
 Like Jesus is an old person.
 Like he's old.
 Like...
 You know, like Adam is old.
 You know, if you're alive, you're young and we're like children.
 And there's all these things, these sharp edges, these corners, these anxieties, these fears,
 these things put in our food, our diet, our diet of what we consume right here that turn
 us old and make us brittle and make us put that fear on our kids.
 Don't you put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby?
 They put that...
 They put that...
 We put these evils on our children.
 We put racism on our children.
 We put fear on our children.
 And the children are fearless.
 The children...
 It's funny.
 It's like Claudio Svester and one of our lead architects that worked with since age 24.
 He built this home in Morocco with John Paulson and he has like this golf course which
 it's in...
 The acoustics are incredible.
 But it's this part where you can walk along that's 20 feet high.
 And I said, you know, would you...
 What about the kids?
 You know, you have a balcony, you have a banister or something?
 And he looked at me and said, they're smarter than we think.
 Wow.
 And meaning like if we were never taught the missing banister theory that we could all
 tight-rope walk.
 The missing banister theory I wrote in my book, thank you and you're welcome.
 I wrote my friend, Sakaya, that's actually here right now that you were talking to earlier
 is...
 You could walk down a straight line without worrying about anything.
 But you take that exact straight line and put a 20 story high, 20 story high.
 You know I'm going with it.
 And you remove the balconies.
 You're going to be so concerned about the idea of falling that it will make you fall.
 And that's where the superpower is in removing the fear.
 Yes.
 That's a beautiful thing to say right there.
 And it's also probably the first sound biteable thing that I've said the entire...
 Alright, let me talk to you about...
 So we're serious here.
 So let's talk about like real presidential issues.
 Let's talk about like here's some things that...
 Just when we talk about this country, here's some things that mean a lot to me.
 One student debt.
 I think it's crazy.
 I think it's crazy that we take children when they're 17, 18 years old.
 We send them away to college.
 We make them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
 And then we ask them to go out into the world and try to manage this money and try to get
 a job that's going to pay them a fraction of what they owe for their education.
 I think it's crazy.
 I think we should figure out a way to absolve student debt.
 I think we should figure out a way to make education at the very least far less expensive
 than it is now.
 This is a big issue for people.
 I'm completely confident that I will figure out how to get a America out of debt that I
 have the ability.
 Once I see everything, I never make the wrong decision when I'm giving all the information.
 That's my skill set.
 Anything I go into, produce in, rap, homes, clothing, anything.
 Once I'm given the right information, I apply my taste.
 I have the best taste on the planet.
 I mean, Quincy Jones is a couple of people.
 That's like, okay, Quincy Jones' taste might be better than mine.
 But could you imagine Quincy Jones as a president?
 I could.
 Yeah.
 Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, maybe some of these personalities are a little volatile.
 Yeah, yeah.
 But that's how he gets things done.
 For America to be as warming and inviting as Disney World, there used to be this dream of,
 people still have this dream of coming to America.
 It's the America that I grew up, even with like when Ronald Reagan was in office, he was
 hanging out with Michael Jackson.
 It felt, plus the way the media showed things, the American dream.
 It was alive and well.
 Even at the same time in the ghetto, it was a living hell.
 We were being given bricks were put on the street, bricks were put on the street doing
 the riots now, bricks were put on the street in 80s, different kind of brick.
 There were guns placed and the fathers were being taken out of the hood.
 This is all the, so don't let me say like everything was perfect doing that era, but the
 perception right now, perception is more important than it's ever been.
 Like what we show, you know, it's just, I mean, it's outright.
 It's just, I don't even want to, I don't know, I don't even want to dwell on it.
 Let's keep going into what you're saying about the debt.
 Because also, I don't have, like if you were asked me about COVID, I could only give you
 my perspective as a civilian.
 I don't, I'm not talking to these, the same people.
 You know, and also in power, the geniuses, I was talking to my man Fred and my boy Anthony
 about crypto and Bitcoin, you know, the yesterday, just to be prepped for this conversation
 and not about the specifics of alternate currencies, which is like AC, which is like Tesla,
 which is like, but the, this is how my mind just goes on these like ribs right here.
 But Jack Dorsey decentralized Twitter two months before it really hit because he was
 talking to the Bitcoin guys.
 And these are guys that really have a perspective on what the true liberation of America and humanity
 will be.
 These guys, a lot of the, the specific these guys, but a lot of the tech guys were able to
 use the new highways, the new information highways and create the next frontier of our existence.
 Now, the powers of our political system are still anchoring on electoral college, which
 was based around slavery about the idea of slaves being three fifths of man and get this.
 It wasn't even created by pro slaves.
 Three fifths of man was created by the anti slaves in the North as a compromise.
 And that basically explains the existence of black people in America to, to this day,
 the people that were on our side supposedly said we were three fifths of man.
 The people that were on our side, the people on our side thought of us as three fifths of
 man, meaning like, yeah, come work for us.
 But you know, you're three fifths of man sitting, you have electoral college and Jerry
 Mandarin happening to this date where if you have Latinos, blacks, other minorities, they're
 redrawing the lines to affect the vote to this day.
 That does not relate to the information highway that we live in today that allow all these,
 you know, tech guys to become multibillionaires and lead, and lead free thought or allow, you
 know, as best as we could a version of free thought.
 I know I gave you a symphony, but you see how all this really connects with sticking,
 you know, why don't we just keep, why don't we put the white wigs back on?
 They still wear the white wigs out in England.
 Yeah, England, they still wear it.
 You know, that's the whole thing.
 Just because, you know, someone's not, you know, wearing a KKK uniform or a white wig,
 does it mean that they aren't holding on to the very core of the country being, you
 know, based on and built off of slavery.
 So when everyone's saying vote, you know, that's the reason why my mother says vote Kanye,
 because it's like vote for who?
 But man, if you ain't gonna say who you voting on out loud, don't even wear the vote t-shirt,
 that's so random.
 Right.
 That's so rare.
 And we obviously know vote is like Democrat and it's not because there's nobody is the Trump
 that's like wears a vote t-shirt.
 Isn't that funny?
 But it's such a, go ahead.
 If you do say that, yeah, you say vote is mostly vote Democrat.
 Like, and if you have an American flag, mostly you're voting Trump.
 Like these are, these are realities that we've sort of accepted.
 And it's subs.
 It's all this subliminal stuff that's based on like fear and control, even like this,
 like this, look at this.
 The whole, this is the three fifths of man thing, right?
 Okay.
 The Democrat were willing to take the chance of not winning as long as the conglomerate
 could be completely in control of, as, completely in control.
 You know what I'm saying that?
 Bernie.
 Bernie would have won.
 This is the, I wore a trumpet.
 I'm saying like Bernie is a superhero.
 You know, and he would be the perfect, the perfect, the perfect person to be the opposite
 of what Trump represents.
 Yeah.
 He's an anti-capitalist.
 He's a guy who's a social Democrat.
 And, but you know the problem, they couldn't control Bernie because you can't control him.
 He's been so consistent in his whole life.
 So what I'm saying is they literally kicked, and this doesn't say something.
 It's like they kicked the superhero.
 You know what I'm saying?
 They, they, they, they, they, they want to control.
 It's the same thing they did with Tulsi Gabbard.
 But Bernie was interesting because he's this Democratic socialist because he's got these
 ideas that are scary to capitalism.
 You know what was funny because I created the birthday party, which on the, on the next
 election, what's going to happen is, I mean, you guys got 300 million viewers, you know,
 after this, it'd probably be 900 million because you know, I run a stock up and I was
 like, you're still a little bit of vote call.
 You're being like, you're a...
 No doubt.
 Jello pudding, I was exactly, exactly.
 So, so there's a long rant, but I really would like to talk to you about specific things.
 Okay.
 I mean, it was a beautiful long symphony.
 But there's a, there's a, there's a pop.
 We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't usually, we don't, we don't usually, we're
 cap, maybe a, okay, we're, an end note.
 Ding.
 That's actually the beginning of the run away.
 But there's a possibility that I could, it's actually technically possible for me to
 win now, which would be the best option for America.
 I would, I'm on a 12 ballots and in 17 states that you could write me in on.
 So, people, God, people that never voted, God, a registered voter for me that have to
 take it, take it to the house because I would, you know, I could possibly win now.
 I'm definitely 100% winning in 2024.
 And with that thought, I was like, okay, I got the birthday party, but I was thinking
 maybe there's a possibility I would be, they said that wouldn't happen.
 I was digging, I would possibly be the Democrat, you know, I don't think they would ever let
 you in like that.
 But I don't know, maybe who knows what happens after this Joe Biden, Kamala Harris thing?
 Who knows, who knows what they think?
 I would be the first, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm one of the first super famous public black
 free will, uh, servants of Christ, uh, since modern media has come to pass.
 Meaning, when I, when I, when I talk, I'm not talking for a conglomerate.
 I'm talking for myself in service to God.
 That's it.
 That's it.
 Like, I'm not, you know, I'll, I'll cover my people, cover my family, but there's not
 some big plan or like some practice script thing where it says, you go in and you, you say
 this, you, you do this.
 We've got, we want to keep selling Kodak film.
 So we want to stop, you know, you from bringing out the digital camera.
 We want to keep, you know, selling this, raising the price of gas.
 So we're not going to look to how to like safely harness nuclear power or to do electric
 power.
 Okay, go ahead, ask another question.
 I really just, I quite love the sound of my own voices.
 We could say it apparently.
 It's okay.
 So it's just a microphone.
 We started.
 It sounds great.
 We, so we started with student debt.
 And we got, we got on this long symphony.
 Yeah.
 Um, have you given thought into the idea of free education and particularly, here's a big
 one for me as well, free healthcare?
 I think if we think of ourselves as a country and our country as a community, where we're
 all bunch of people that are together, if we're going to take care of things like the
 fire department, if we're going to take care of things like the police department, education,
 we've got to take care of healthcare.
 We got, we got to make it so that people get sick.
 They don't go bankrupt.
 We got to make it so that no one has to worry about being taken care of.
 And I, and I don't mean to eliminate the ability for someone to hire a private specialist
 for surgery or anything like that.
 I'm not, I'm not saying that, but I'm saying at the very least, we have to cover base medical
 concerns for the population.
 It's just, it's a giant part of what, what it is to be a person is to, to worry about your,
 your body being broken, to worry about being sick, to worry about what is going to cost
 your family financially and how it could ruin people.
 This is, I mean, this is a huge issue in our country is medical health.
 So if you, if you thought about that, absolutely.
 I, I hear you and I feel you and I feel what people are going through.
 I think that there is a, it's not just how we treat people.
 There's preventative measures that can help us from getting sick or our diet, our, our
 locations, our, our, our jobs.
 There's a lot of that that affects us and puts us in those, uh, situation, our transportation,
 you know, like, uh, as you go into like autonomous, uh, vehicles and tram systems, like just
 kind of, you know, trains that are like, uh, floating malls or floating, uh, Starbucks
 or something like movement, like designing our world to be the world of the future will,
 uh, will help us with health.
 That's the preventative measures.
 And then as far as, uh, being more inventive in the way we, um, we connect, uh, holistic,
 uh, medicine with modern medicine.
 I believe in both medicines.
 I believe in God, I believe in God and nature.
 I believe in, uh, science and physics.
 And, you know, it's like the first simplest form of bioengineering, uh, I think was farming.
 And to be able to have, like I talk about the, the guys at MIT, the greatest scientists
 and the world, there's people who are, that are like the elons of the, the medical
 field, but perhaps they're sitting there on the, on the, on the floors, like servant
 on the front line, fighting COVID, uh, where, you know, they didn't have the opportunity
 to create PayPal and become a billionaire and go to the next idea or when they present
 it and want people to invest in these inventions that they have, they haven't had the voice
 of the platform to bring this invention.
 There's cures to things like one of the things is the silver bullet.
 Like what I went through with the medication when they gave me the medication that made
 me fat, but then they said, okay, we have one that doesn't.
 We all know what a silver bullet is in medication, right?
 So it's the, um, it's a medication that goes and just kills exactly what it's supposed
 to kill.
 But for capitalism, that's not the best medication to actually cure people.
 Capitalists want to keep people.
 They want to treat them.
 They want to treat them.
 They want to keep you sick because that's how you keep making money to have a guy.
 Like for me, when I say I put my life on the line, I think about Abraham Lincoln, I think
 about JFK to go in and sit and say, you know, the whole thing is, no, everyone is going
 to be more prosperous as they get the word.
 That's specifically, are you going to five extra money?
 Everyone's like trying to get it.
 No, it's about prosperity and to be able to really have real conversations with the lead
 heads of like big farm and real conversations with the heads of, uh, of, uh, holistic and,
 and, and natural healing to put these people in a room together.
 People aren't even having, they're mad at each other.
 They're afraid of each other.
 Uh, I, uh, I donated to a Christian school in Cody and, um, I also went by and saw this
 other amazing school in, uh, in Cody where they have, uh, autistic children and kids,
 kids with special needs in the same classrooms as, uh, other, as regular kids.
 And I just saw this juxtaposition and the head of that, that, uh, school is, uh, a Christian,
 but it's a state school.
 So there's no prayer in the school.
 And then the other school is fully Christian, but it's not a state school.
 So they don't have money in the school.
 And I wanted to have dinner with, uh, both of the principals come to find out the principal
 and these guys, they talk maybe out of softball game or some, the principal house is one block
 walking distance.
 The principal of one school's house is one block walking distance from the school of
 the other principal that were this close right now.
 We have the solutions, but we all have our backs to each other.
 We need to face each other and like how we're facing each other right now and have these
 conversations.
 The solutions for utopia are in front of us, but what's holding us back fear.
 People are sitting on their money.
 Really they're sitting under their money.
 I know I'm going to give you a thing.
 Okay.
 Did you get, did you get my perspective of the way I approach you would bring people
 together to communicate and try to figure out a better strategy for healthcare?
 Yeah.
 I mean, and and and and London some reality some financial realities that have to be
 and London when you go to the hospital, no, let me give you the American example.
 When I go to the hospital, I had something wrong with my foot three years ago.
 They asked me, do you know, do you want to take something, do you want to pill?
 I said no.
 Five doctors and nurses asked me if I want to pill.
 This is like worse than when you don't accept water on the plane and they just keep like,
 do you want some more water?
 I'll take the water because I don't want to be responsible for the water like when the
 plane takes off and it goes like this and I got like, hold it on my, I don't want no
 water.
 Like, I don't even know my like my suit said I should drink more water.
 So the so they they are like people they have Christmas parties about bonuses about giving
 out more medication.
 So when we talk about they do look at this.
 How much does the earth cost?
 Sorry.
 There's no price on it, right?
 We make money.
 Money's not even backed by goal anymore.
 So it's engineering.
 It's where the budgets are going and like it was the best part on one of the best parts
 on the six cents is when when they looked at this video and it was a nanny, they saw that
 the nanny was like putting stuff in the like the porch for the child that had passed and
 then they said, the lady's looked at the nanny and said, you're keeping her sick.
 You're keeping her sick.
 Like we are sick.
 We are sick.
 Abortion culture, sex culture, capitalism.
 We are sick.
 We as a people as a not just the American society, the world.
 We are sick and we are keeping ourselves sick.
 We're all responsible like the black mirror episode.
 We're all responsible in some way.
 We all play some part like if I go to PornHub and the very next thing and like backslide
 and do this because I've struggled with this since I was like five years old, right?
 And the very next thing says something about like trafficking, then I literally would
 have to like put my hand over that part and like click the thing I'm going to and thinking
 that like I'm not a part of the bigger conglomerate that we're all, oh I'm not really a part
 of the main problem because I'm not as bad as that guy and I'm not looking at this part
 and I'm not like we all play a part of it and we're all sick in some way and the world
 has been designed to keep us sick.
 Like spatial engineering based off faith can save a world literally like building will
 save the world.
 Spatial engineering like engineer not going to space engineering our spaces, the amount
 of space that we need, the way that we interact with each other, how close we are to our
 loved ones, our family, how close we are to our jobs.
 We got to experience a lot of this.
 Some people, it wasn't good.
 Some people it's better.
 They were connected with their children and their families in a whole different way.
 Like we're talking, this is my thing.
 We could talk about all of these important current issues.
 There's deeper reasons based on the slave mentality, based on fear, based on protectionism.
 That's specifically white supremacy and racism.
 People just want to protect what they have and there's this like photograph where you're
 holding the guys, the little girls holding a teddy bear and Jesus has a giant teddy bear
 behind her back.
 I mean behind his back she don't want to give up the small teddy bear for the bigger teddy
 bear that Jesus has waiting for her.
 There is prosperity for all families here on earth right now in service to God.
 There's happiness.
 There's joy.
 Isn't that a possibility?
 It's a probability.
 Just the fact that God woke me up, got me here safely and allowed me to talk to you right
 now and spark the minds of the people that are anointed to change the world is already what
 God wanted me to do.
 If I didn't take a breath after this point, God had me here for this conversation right
 now.
 But I think God has more for me plan.
 I don't think they're going to come for me until he done for until he done with me.
 They ain't going to come for me until they done with me.
 I want to make it so someone that's going to sample and put it in a beat it would be
 like perfect.
 I'm going to say it.
 They ain't going to come for me until he done with me.
 They ain't going to come for me until he done with me.
 I don't think so.
 I'm sorry.
 Yeah.
 And help me, you're always creating.
 Now, but do you understand what I'm saying?
 You're going to go, okay, tell me what I'm saying.
 What you're saying is that it's your overall philosophy, the way you're approaching life,
 your approaching life that there is good for everyone.
 If we all work together, if we all work together in the spirit of the way you think, the spirit
 of God that not approach this like with a famine mentality, but approach this like there's
 enough for everybody.
 There's an abundance if we if we engineer it correctly, if we think about it correctly,
 if we all come together with the spirit of everybody helping everybody.
 This is the spirit of Christianity.
 This is the good spirit of Christianity, not the Christianity that gets despised or disparaged
 or evangelist driving around in private jets.
 The spirit of goodness and treating each other like brothers and sisters.
 Yes.
 But this can be done on a national scale.
 Yes.
 Because those evangelists or the people who spread the word of God, there's people who
 were praying for me.
 We're praying.
 Like I said, I like to, okay, yes, I am a genius, but one of my most genius skill sets is
 recognizing other geniuses and empowering them and giving them the platform.
 So the people that have been praying for me this whole time, you know, for yay to work
 for the kingdom, look at me.
 Look at me right here, working from the kingdom, not leaning on my ego, not leaning on anything
 but leaning on God in this situation saying, let's rise up together and show people what
 it's like to be Christ like.
 Yeah, we fall short.
 You know what I mean?
 People love to like look at the Christians that are the least Christ like to judge Christianity
 as a whole.
 Well, a lot of people got joins in 23 years old and don't very few of them play like LeBron.
 You know, they want to be like Mike.
 Yes.
 But it's very few people that get that close.
 You know what I like.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 What you're saying is beautiful.
 Yeah.
 That they do judge the people that fail.
 People always go to the furthest extent.
 Like if you talk about abortion culture, people immediately go to rape, but don't do the
 math on what percentage that is.
 And for me as a Christian president, you know, as I said, I go on that, I touched on
 it before.
 I realize we're in an imperfect world.
 You know, when I talk to my fellow Christians and we talk about meat, we talk about guns,
 we talk about in this imperfect world, there's a transition between where we are today and
 where we're going.
 There's, yeah, there's a meat industry.
 You have a great impact on the ozone from what I hear.
 It does.
 And we have to transition.
 One of the things I wanted is a thought that came in and thank you for allowing me to
 give you the thoughts that are coming into my head as opposed to trying to put me on a
 grid.
 The way I think I paint in circles, you know, I don't paint inside of the lines, right?
 So I was thinking about, I forget the lady's name starts with a T, but she changed the meat
 industry because she was HSP, like highly sensitive person.
 That's and put the cows in a round bins.
 And that's what I'm doing when I say spatial engineering.
 That's what I'm doing with our spaces that I'm designing with the farms and with the
 school systems, the unlearned systems, what are the things that you're going to need, you
 know, in the future because 30 years, we don't even know.
 We think probably the things that we're learning in school right now won't even apply to people
 when they're 30 years old that are learning this stuff, you know, age.
 Especially with technology.
 And the people who designed the curriculums are dead.
 But they did way before technology.
 Yeah.
 So I mean, I was in computer program and when I was eight years old and I used to know
 how to program.
 This I got into music in seventh grade.
 I had a mega computer that had 4,096 colors.
 That's why I got that one.
 And I would program the different sprites and draw out each of the characters and animate
 them.
 And I thought that was the next frontier to like, because I would do like animation books.
 I wanted to be an animator.
 And then I started doing the music.
 They had a music program on to the music for the video games.
 And then I found myself running home from school all the way from 95th Street to 119th Street
 to go and just keep programming the music.
 So this is like third age, you know, 12, 13, you know, programming video games and that
 being the gateway into programming music.
 I got a longer story about that, but I know you want to ask me some more serious stuff.
 So ding.
 Okay, this is a big one.
 The military.
 If you really did become president, when you do become president, you're going to have
 to deal with hostile governments.
 You're going to have to deal with hostile militaries and dictators, you know, people in other
 country that and other countries that don't have a value of human life and throughout
 history, we've had immense problems because of that, because of military conflicts.
 How do you think you will approach that?
 You will be the commander in chief of the greatest army the world has ever known.
 If you're in that position and we have to deal with some sort of a military action with
 China, what if China takes over Taiwan?
 What if they invade Taiwan?
 What if something happens with Syria?
 What if something happens with Iran?
 What if something happens with Russia?
 And you have to make decisions about military action.
 Have you thought about this?
 Yes, I would.
 Let's say again, like COVID, I'm a civilian and people can have all their perspectives that
 they can have of what they would do in that situation.
 But I would have the greatest professionals on the planet, the most skilled people that
 have all the experience that would present the information and I would make the most sound
 rational decisions and I would follow God's will in my approach to dealing with these
 other countries, to dealing with these other leaders.
 There's something about our president's personality and the leader of North Korea's personality
 where there's a level of common respect and that's the reason why they were able to talk
 and the fear had been taken off of us, like people who are God-fearing, self-made servants
 of their people, these other scary dictators, they feel like they're that for their country.
 And if they see a president that they know is just taking a check or a part of a bigger
 conglomerate, like I said, I wanted to announce any of the candidates, then it's very transactional.
 It's a prayer in this situation.
 This isn't the prayer because of what motivated you to say a prayer right there.
 The seriousness, the significance of this subject?
 Yeah, absolutely.
 We can't jump from jokes about this to joking about people's lives.
 We have to completely be still in this moment, allow God to guide our steps and ask the
 right questions with the highest ranking officials possible.
 This isn't something that you just winged or that you just come in and say, I did a bit
 of research.
 I got this political answer that's going to get a rise out of people like this is people's
 lives.
 This is a whole different setting or mood than what this whole interview has been about.
 People are suffering throughout all sides in Israel and Nigeria and Haiti.
 We're suffering the police force in Chicago and the people have been harmed by police
 and the police force.
 This all is going to take serious time.
 Time is love.
 It's going to take that love and that time and moments of listening, moments of understanding,
 moments like when my wife goes and visits people in prison and she hears their stories.
 She says, I understand.
 I understand why you're into, why you're in that situation.
 I would have did the same thing in this situation.
 First to go to foreign countries and really understand why that there are any situations
 or why the killing has gone for so long or why the hate has gone so long and why the
 pain just keeps on compounding and compacting.
 There's an empathy that I just have as an artist that it doesn't become a two plus two
 equals four situation.
 My dad was actually a psychology major and a Christian therapist.
 This therapy, we talk about therapy period.
 It's like we need healing internationally, not just selfishly for America.
 America is number one.
 Internationally, we need healing and I would lead.
 I would lead with love, dignity, the responsibility to our country, the coverage of our families,
 of our soldiers, and in full service to God into the American people.
 It's the, there's a mode that I would be in in that position.
 When I was a producer and I was a really young man, I was running around hopping on trains
 or hopping turns styles and stuff and stealing from cars.
 That stealing cars was still in clothes from stores and then I was selling music and
 going and buying leather jackets and stuff, dating a whole bunch of girls going on tour.
 Then I had a family and I had to adjust a lot of my mentality and behavior to grow and
 be the man that I needed to be.
 Even God called me and I gave my life to Christ and God is helping me to be the Christian
 that I need to be.
 When it's in God's will that I become the leader, I will become the leader that I need to
 be.
 Right now as I said, I'm a civilian but my heart, my mind and my spirit is in a place
 where I feel, I know that I'm being called to captain this ship.
 Like when Roosevelt went in, America was in shambles.
 When I'd say those things about those numbers, when I went to Adidas, when I went to Gap,
 like I'm the person that you actually call when things are not going so well.
 You know what you had?
 The mob movies is the guy that goes cleans up everything and like puts everything.
 I'm like the forensic where in the same way how you saw my mind touch on 10 things at
 a time and then I had to say 10 sentences at a time.
 If I could say I might be narrowed down to seven, that's the way my mind takes information
 in and then synthesize it and it comes out as a song or it comes out as a product.
 Using that mentality as a leader, fearless, God fearing, we will heal.
 We will show the world what America should be.
 The dream.
 You've said all this shit, all the things that you've said in the most non-politician way
 I've ever heard anybody describe these things.
 I know you really mean these things.
 It's resonating with me that you're being 100% honest and natural and that's what we're
 missing in politics today.
 I mean, it's one of the things that made people excited about Trump as at least he was
 an alternative to the political talk.
 He was an alternative to politician speak where you know they're being dishonest and
 disingenuous but you just accept it.
 You know they're reading things that have been written by speech writers but you just
 accept it because it says the things that you want to hear, checks the boxes that will
 say, okay, you got my vote.
 What you're saying though is what you really feel and you really think and you're not saying
 that like a politician and that's what's going to resonate and people are going to be mad
 at me.
 If you get president, you've made Kanye West seem like a bull.
 You turned him into the fucking president.
 You made him seem like a rational choice for president.
 This conversation exposes a side of you that I don't think anybody's ever seen before
 and a long form conversation where you realize that you are a visionary.
 You do have these ideas are real.
 You're not posing.
 There's not bullshit.
 This is who you are and you're well thought out response particularly to the idea of
 military conflict.
 It's very impressive man.
 Praise God.
 I'm glad I did that prayer.
 Brother, with three hours into this, let's wrap this up on a beautiful high note.
 So people can write you in if they want to and we have a video on that.
 Brian.
 Yeah.
 Brian will play this video on how they can write you in and we'll wrap it up here.
 Here it is.
 How to write in Kanye West on your belt.
 Now for people that are watching this on YouTube, you'll be able to watch this and on
 Spotify.
 You'll be able to watch this.
 You're just listening.
 You just got to go down to the part where it says or write in.
 It's pretty straightforward.
 Write in candidates.
 It'll show you where you can write it in.
 This video will be available.
 This video is on YouTube, right?
 It's on his Twitter.
 It's on Twitter.
 Okay.
 Write in Kanye West on your ballot.
 It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with this.
 I'm telling you man, that was one of the most interesting and important.
 It was a impressive answer to any question because it was so obvious that you were coming
 from the heart and that's what we all need right now.
 We all need no bullshit.
 Absolutely.
 Thank you, brother.
 It was an honor.
 Really?
 Thank you.
 It was a pleasure.
 I'm glad we finally did it.
 Awesome.
 This won't be the last time.
 All right.
 Let's do it again.
 Goodbye everybody.
